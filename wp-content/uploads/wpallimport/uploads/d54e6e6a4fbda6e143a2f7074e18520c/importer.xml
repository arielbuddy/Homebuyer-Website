		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whatIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Exactly is a Mortgage Pre-approval?</h2> <p>A mortgage pre-approval uses your verified credit score, income documentation, bank statements, and employment verification to approve you, as a buyer, to purchase a home.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>Once pre-approved, you'll receive an itemized estimate of interest rates, closing costs, monthly payments, and the maximum amount you're approved to buy. This information is crucial to understanding how much you can borrow.&nbsp;</p> <p>Be wary of lenders that suggest a pre-qualification because these are not the same as a pre-approval.</p> <h3>What is the Difference Between Pre-qualification and Pre-approval?</h3> <p>A pre-qualification does not use verified information to approve you, whereas a pre-approval does.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pre-qualifications use self-reported information and don't take the additional steps to verify it. Pre-qualifications provide estimates rather than accurate numbers.</p> <p>A pre-approval requires an actual credit check and supporting financial documentation, which gives a precise, customized quote for every home buyer.</p> <p>Learn about the difference between <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/pre-qualification-vs-pre-approval"><span>pre-approval vs. pre-qualification.</span></a></p> <a id="Benefits" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">4 Main Benefits of Getting Pre-approved Before You House Hunt</h2> <p>There are lots of great reasons to get pre-approved, but here are the four main things that will help ensure you'll be ready when the time comes to purchase a home:</p> <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">1. Provides Accurate Credit Checks</h3> <p>Pre-approvals make a hard credit inquiry. This hard inquiry will accurately gauge your credit, unlike many free tools you might find online. If your credit qualifies, then you're an approved buyer who can put in a serious offer on a home you love.</p> <p>If your credit doesn't qualify, you'll know exactly why, and you'll learn how to improve it. By getting approved early, you'll have enough time to take the necessary steps to raise your score before putting in your offer.</p> <p>Learn about <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>what credit score you need to buy a house.</span></a></p> <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">2. Required to House Hunt</h3> <p>If you aren't pre-approved, sellers and realtors won't take your offer seriously. Pre-approvals are accurate assessments of your financial status that show you are ready to buy and can afford the property when you submit an offer.</p> <p>Depending on where and when you are looking, you might also need a pre-approval to view houses.&nbsp;</p> <h3>3. Sets Your Budget Accurately</h3> <p>Pre-approvals don't only show the maximum loan amount you get approved for. They also come with an itemized estimate of your interest rate, monthly payment, and closing costs.</p> <p>This estimate lets you know how much down payment you need, if you need any at all, and will help you narrow down your budget, making it easier to choose what homes you want to see in person.</p> <h3>4. Shows How Much You Want to Borrow&nbsp;</h3> <p>Many buyers are pre-approved for more than they want to spend. And it's important to know that you don't need to borrow as much as you are pre-approved for.</p> <p>A pre-approval will help you find a comfortable monthly payment that works for you.&nbsp;</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: 0px auto 25px;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe loading="lazy" width="747" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8hJzzr9Aa4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <a id="howTo" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How to Get Your Mortgage Pre-approval</h2> <p>You can get pre-approved in a few minutes online, in person, or over the phone. All a mortgage lender will need to look at is:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Your credit history</li> <li aria-level="1">Employment history</li> <li aria-level="1">Income verification</li> <li aria-level="1">Total assets</li> <li aria-level="1">Your desired down payment and mortgage amount</li> </ul> <p>Homebuyer can do this for you in minutes by clicking below.</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p> <a id="whenShould" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>When Should You Get Pre-approved?</h2> <p>You should get pre-approved as soon as possible. The earlier you get pre-approved, the easier it is to start viewing homes and make any changes to your finances to ensure that you're ready to put in an offer.</p> <p>Plus, all the information from your pre-approval can get used for your actual mortgage. By the time you're pre-approved, you're halfway through the mortgage process.</p> <a id="doesA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Does a Pre-approval Affect Your Credit Score?</h2> <p>Yes, a pre-approval will run a hard credit check that will lower your credit score <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-many-points-does-an-inquiry-drop-your-credit-score/" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>by five points or less</span></a>. But as long as you keep paying your bills during that time, your credit score will return to normal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Getting multiple pre-approvals shouldn't hurt you if you shop for different lenders to get the best deal. Depending on the credit scoring model, you'll have a shopping period of <a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/report/understanding-hard-inquiries-on-your-credit-report/" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>14 to 45 days</span></a> where similar inquiries are all counted as one and don't affect your credit any further.</p> <p>Learn more about <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/does-pre-approval-affect-credit-score"><span>how your pre-approval can affect your credit score</span></a>.</p> <a id="howLong" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Long Does a Mortgage Pre-approval Last?</h2> <p>Mortgage pre-approvals are typically good for 90 days. This is because lenders know your financial situation will change over time – everything from your credit score to interest rates will fluctuate.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you haven't found a home within that 90-day time frame, contact your mortgage expert, provide some updated information, and they'll refresh your pre-approval for another 90 days.</p> <p>Learn about <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for"><span>how long your mortgage pre-approval is good for.</span></a></p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>There are no downsides to getting pre-approved early. Going into the home buying process unprepared and uninformed is dangerous.</p> <p>A pre-approval will go a long way towards helping you understand the information that is truly important to you for buying a home.&nbsp;</p> <p>{{cta('0d860a55-feb6-4352-9199-544349a15c5b')}}</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="mortgageGiftLetter" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Is a Mortgage Gift Letter?</h2> <p>A mortgage gift letter is a signed letter from a donor certifying that their down payment gift money comes with no repayment expectations.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>Money gifts from friends and family are a common way to help cover home buying expenses, like the down payment and closing costs. Lenders want to ensure that this money isn’t a loan, since additional debt may affect your mortgage approval.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mortgage gift letter is an easy way to assure your lender that you don’t owe friends and family for their gift funds.&nbsp;</p> <a id="writeMortgageGiftLetter" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Do You Write a Gift Letter for a Mortgage?</h2> <p>A mortgage gift letter must include the donor’s name and information, the gift amount, and other details about the home and gift. It’s written and signed by the donor, but your mortgage lender may have a template available to use.&nbsp;</p> <p>A mortgage gift letter must include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Donor’s name and contact information</li> <li aria-level="1">Address of property being purchased</li> <li aria-level="1">Donor and buyer’s relationship</li> <li aria-level="1">Gift amount</li> <li aria-level="1">Date of gift transfer</li> <li aria-level="1">A statement that repayment isn’t expected by the donor</li> <li aria-level="1">Donor’s bank, account number, and type of account</li> <li aria-level="1">Donor’s signature</li> </ul> <p>Once the gift letter is complete, you can provide documentation to your lender. Notaries aren’t required.</p> <a id="giftLetterTemplate" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h3>Mortgage Gift Letter Template</h3> <p>If your lender doesn’t offer a mortgage gift letter template, it’s easy to write yourself. Copy and customize our template below:</p> <hr> <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 991.469px; border-color: #FFFFFF;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 277px;"> <td style="width: 100%; padding: 4px; height: 277px; border-color: #FFFFFF;" colspan="2"> <p><strong>To:</strong> [Name/Address of Lender]</p> <p>I/We, [DONOR NAMES], certify our gift of $[GIFT AMOUNT] to [BUYER] is given without any expectation of repayment, implied or otherwise.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our gift of $[GIFT AMOUNT] is to be applied toward the purchase of:</p> <p>[HOUSE ADDRESS]</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 223.156px;"> <td style="width: 50%; padding: 4px; height: 223px; border-color: #FFFFFF;"> <p><strong>Money Given By:</strong></p> <p>Name: [DONOR NAME]<br>Relationship To Buyer: [RELATIONSHIP]<br>Phone: [PHONE NUMBER]<br>Address: [DONOR ADDRESS]</p> </td> <td style="width: 50%; padding: 4px; height: 223px;"> <p><strong>Money Received By:</strong></p> <p>Name: [BUYER NAME]<br>Phone: [PHONE NUMBER]<br>Address: [DONOR ADDRESS]</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 464.312px;"> <td style="border: 1pt solid #000000; width: 100%; padding: 4px; height: 464px; border-color: #FFFFFF;" colspan="2"> <p><strong>Source of Gift Funds:</strong></p> <p>Bank: [BANK NAME]<br>Account Type: [CHECKING/SAVINGS]<br><span style="font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">Account Number: [ACCOUNT NUMBER]<br></span>Deposited: [DATE DEPOSITED]</p> <p>Buyer’s Signature: _______________________________&nbsp; Date: __________</p> <p>Donor’s Signature: _______________________________&nbsp; Date: __________</p> <p>*<em>Upon signing this gift letter, we certify that funds given to the home buyer were not made available by any persons or entities with interests in the sale of the above property, including the seller, real estate agent, lender, or other parties involved in the transaction.</em></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr> <p>When you make your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/timeline-for-buying-a-house/"><span>home buying timeline</span></a><span style="color: #666666;">, </span>ask donors to provide a mortgage gift letter once your offer is accepted and before you close on the house.</p> <p>Once all parties have signed the letter, you can deliver it to your lender for documentation.</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/mortgage-gift-letter%20(1).pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/mortgage-gift-download%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Click to download editable mortgage gift letter template."></a></p> <a id="loanType" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Mortgage Gifts by Loan Type</h2> <p>Mortgage gift requirements will depend on the type of mortgage loan used to buy a home. All single-family, primary residence purchases can apply gift funds to a down payment, depending on who donates the money.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Conventional Loans and Mortgage Gifts</h3> <p>Conventional loans are the most common loan choice for first-time buyers and require that gift money donors are related to the buyer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Family members eligible to donate gift funds include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The buyer’s spouse</li> <li aria-level="1">Children or dependents</li> <li aria-level="1">Blood relatives</li> <li aria-level="1">Legal relatives (for example, relatives by marriage, adoption, or legal guardianship)</li> <li aria-level="1">Domestic partners or fiance/fiancee</li> </ul> <p>Friends and other parties can’t donate to conventional loan mortgage gifts.&nbsp;</p> <h3>FHA Loans and Mortgage Gifts</h3> <p>FHA loans allow more than just family and friends to donate money. Donors may include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Immediate family</li> <li aria-level="1">Close friends</li> <li aria-level="1">Employers</li> <li aria-level="1">Labor unions</li> <li aria-level="1">Charity organizations</li> </ul> <p>Extended family, including cousins, nieces, and nephews, can’t contribute to <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/4155-1_5_SECB.PDF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>FHA loan down payments</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <h3>USDA and VA Loans and Mortgage Gifts</h3> <p>USDA and <a href="https://benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26-07/Chapter_4.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>VA loans</span></a> are the most flexible with down payment gifts. These loans have no restrictions based on the relationship to the buyer.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, donors can’t have an interest in the property’s sale. Prohibited donors may include the seller, real estate agents, lender, and others participating in the transaction.&nbsp;</p> <p>USDA and VA loans both offer <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/100-mortgage-financing"><span>100 percent mortgage financing</span></a><span style="color: #666666;">,</span> so you can choose to use mortgage gifts for closing costs instead of the down payment.</p> <a id="propertyType" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Mortgage Gift Requirements by Property Type</h2> <p>Most first-time home buyers don’t have to personally contribute to their down payment if they have gift money, down payment assistance, or a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/low-down-payment-mortgage"><span>low down payment mortgage</span></a>.</p> <p>Some property types do have specific requirements for your contributions, though:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Single-family Homes: </strong>Single-family home purchases don’t have required contributions for the buyer. The down payment may be entirely paid through gift monies.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Multi-family Homes: </strong>Buyers must contribute their personal money for 5 percent of the down payment if they’re buying a multi-family or second home with less than 20 percent down.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Investment Properties: </strong>Down payment gifts can’t be used for an investment property.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>You don't have to worry about saving thousands for a down payment if you're buying your first home.</p> <a id="giftLetterFAQ" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Mortgage Gift Letter FAQs</h2> <p>Do you still have unanswered questions? Here’s what you need to know about your mortgage gift letter.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Do Buyers Pay Taxes on Mortgage Gifts?</h3> <p>Buyers don’t pay taxes on their mortgage gifts and don’t have to report gift monies to the IRS.&nbsp;</p> <p>If a donor gifts more than $16,000 to a single buyer in 2022, they’ll be responsible for <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>reporting that donation</span></a> to the IRS. Contact a tax advisor for more information.</p> <h3>What Is the Maximum Gift Amount for a Mortgage?</h3> <p>There is no maximum mortgage gift amount that you can receive or contribute to your down payment. Donors are free to contribute as much as they’d like, and additional funds may be contributed to closing costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only donation limit currently determines when a donor must report their gift to the IRS and doesn’t limit the gift amount. You can receive as much funding that’s available to you.</p> <h3>Does a Mortgage Gift Letter Need To Be Notarized?</h3> <p>No, a mortgage gift letter doesn’t need notarization. A mortgage gift letter should include specific details about the donor, buyer, and gift amount, including:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Donor’s name, address, and relationship to the buyer</li> <li aria-level="1">Buyer’s name</li> <li aria-level="1">Address of property being purchased</li> <li aria-level="1">Gift amount, transfer date, and banking details</li> <li aria-level="1">A statement certifying that the donor doesn’t expect repayment</li> <li aria-level="1">Signatures of the buyer and donor</li> </ul> <p>The lender can confirm the gift amount details through the buyer’s bank statements.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>A mortgage gift is a generous way for friends and family to help you purchase your first home. With enough support, you may buy your home without contributing to the down payment or closing costs yourself.&nbsp;</p> <p>A mortgage gift letter certifies that gift monies have no repayment expectations, so you can receive an accurate mortgage offer without lenders assuming a large amount of new funds is loan debt.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/pre-qualification-vs-pre-approval#hs-chat-open"><span>Chat with us</span></a> or register for our <a href="https://homebuyer.com/start"><span>free home buyer curriculum</span></a> to answer all of your home buying questions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy homebuying.</p> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [ { "@type": "Question", "name": "Do Buyers Pay Taxes On Mortgage Gifts?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Buyers don’t pay taxes on their mortgage gifts and don’t have to report gift monies to the IRS.

It includes information such as the lender's contact info and factors like the estimated interest rate, loan costs, closing costs, and other costs associated with a home purchase. The <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201311_cfpb_kbyo_loan-estimate.pdf">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) provides this standard, three-page document.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>Once you have this information, you can compare rates from different lenders.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How to Read a Loan Estimate</h2> <p>Below is a screenshot of a loan estimate sent to everyone. The sample we're using exists on the CFPB website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/Loan%20Estimate.png" alt="Loan Estimate" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: circular-bold, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;"><strong>Tip: </strong></span>Before you start, ensure that your loan estimate has the same fields as the example above. You should request a new one from your lender if it does not.</p> <h2>Loan Estimate: Page One Simplified</h2> <p>We'll start right at the top.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is general borrower information at the top of the loan estimate. Ficus Bank is a fictitious bank with a fake address.&nbsp;</p> <p>Below that, on the left, you'll find your name. Then the address of the property you're looking to buy.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/Loan-estimate-1-1.png" alt="Loan-estimate-1-1" width="737" loading="lazy" style="width: 737px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></p> <p>On the right, you'll see the loan term, or how long it's going to take you to pay it back. The loan term will typically be 15 - 30 years.</p> <p>Here's what each of the items means:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan Term</strong> is how long it takes to pay off the loan with regular monthly payments.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Purpose</strong> is what you're using the loan to do (buy a home)</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Product</strong> refers to if the loan has a fixed rate or an adjustable rate</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan Type</strong> is the type of loan used&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan ID #</strong> is a reference number used by the lender in their systems</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Rate Lock</strong> is whether the interest rate has been secured or is still subject to daily market changes</li> </ul> <h3>Loan Terms</h3> <p>Below the opening section, you'll see your loan terms.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-3-loan-terms-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-3-loan-terms-1" width="737" loading="lazy" style="width: 737px;"></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan Amount</strong> is the amount you're borrowing or the amount you're pre-approved for</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Interest Rate</strong> is how the amount of interest you pay to the lender</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Monthly Principal &amp; Interest</strong> is your mortgage payment, not including property tax or insurance</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Prepayment Penalty</strong> is if there is a fee for paying off the loan early</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Balloon Payment</strong> is if there is an outstanding amount to be paid at the end of the loan term</li> </ul> <h3>Projected Payments</h3> <p>Next is the Projected Payments section. This section gets broken into two sub-sections, Years 1-7 and 8-30. It is in two parts because it can vary based on whether or not a mortgage insurance payment is involved.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/Loan-estimate-4-projected-payments-1.png" alt="Loan-estimate-4-projected-payments-1" width="737" loading="lazy" style="width: 737px;"></p> <p>It is listed 8-30 because this example is a 30-year loan, as shown in the section above.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s take a look at some of the terms in this section:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Principal</strong>&nbsp;covers the amount of your monthly payment that goes towards paying down your loan balance</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Interest</strong> covers the amount that goes towards paying interest fees to the lender</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Mortgage Insurance</strong>&nbsp;is a monthly payment needed that allows buyers to purchase a home with a downpayment of less than 20%</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Estimated Escrow</strong> is your monthly payment for property taxes and homeowners insurance</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Estimated Taxes, Insurance &amp; Assessments</strong>&nbsp;account for property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and homeowner's association dues</li> </ul> <p>The payment structure gets broken down into estimated monthly payments, including the mortgage insurance of $82. This fee will get paid every month until paid enough for you to have 20 percent equity or an 80 percent loan to value in your property. In this case, it would be every month for seven years.</p> <p>Then you'll see the total of years 1-7 and the 8-30.</p> <h3>Costs at Closing</h3> <p>These estimate closing costs and cash to close refer to totals listed on page two. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Closings Costs</span> include loan costs, other costs, and lender credits.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-2-costs-at-closing-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-2-costs-at-closing-1" width="1439" loading="lazy" style="width: 1439px;"></p> <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Estimated Cash to Close</span> total refers to the amount of cash you will need up-front when closing on your home. This includes your lender fees, third-party charges, and down payment.</p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: circular-bold, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;"><strong>Tip: </strong></span>The majority of page one is estimated. Moving forward, we'll point out what is most important.</p> <h2>Loan Estimate: Page Two Simplified</h2> <p>The second page is a breakdown of all closing costs and prepaids. We'll start at the top left.</p> <h3>Loan Costs - A. Origination Charges</h3> <p>The first section is the Loan Costs, and the subheading gathers your Origination Charges, which is the most crucial section on this entire form. Origination Charges combine your Points, Application Fee, and Underwriting Fee.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-5-origination-charges-2.png" alt="loan-estimate-5-origination-charges-2" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></p> <p>These origination charges can be called different things by different lenders.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this case, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Loan Amount (Points)</span> refers to an <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee">origination fee</a> charged as a percentage of your loan amount. In some cases, you may see a negative number here called a "lender credit." This credit refers to what the lender receives to help pay closing costs.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Application Fee</strong> is a cost associated with processing your mortgage loan and can vary based on the lender.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Underwriting Fee</strong> covers the costs associated with verifying the financial information required to get your mortgage.</li> </ul> <p>Remember, the lender controls this section. Some lenders itemize a dozen different fees, and some include everything in one line item. Another term you may see is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Origination</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Origination Fee</span>, which is a charge assessed by a mortgage lender to process your loan.</p> <p>The main number you want to look at is the total, in bold at the top of the section.</p> <h3>Loan Costs - B. Services You Cannot Shop For</h3> <p>Down in section B, you have Services You Cannot Shop For. Those are services that lenders source for you. These include an Appraisal Fee, a Credit Report Fee, Flood Determination Fee, Flood Monitoring Fee, Tax Monitoring Fee, and Tax status Research Fee.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-6-services-you-cannot-shop-for-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-6-services-you-cannot-shop-for-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>Here's what they mean:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Appraisal Fee</strong> is the amount paid to the home appraiser</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Credit Report Fee</strong> is the cost of your credit report</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Flood Determination Fee</strong> is for determining if the home is in a flood zone</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Flood Monitoring Fee</strong> is to monitor flood maps and make sure the house doesn't fall into a flood zone in the future</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Tax Monitoring Fee</strong> is for tax account monitoring, so the proper parties get notified if there's ever an unpaid tax bill</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Tax Status Research Fee</strong> is to verify the amount due each year and make sure property taxes get paid on time</li> </ul> <p>Since you can't shop for them and the lender sources those services to you, the most important number is in bold at the top of section B.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Loan Costs - C. Services You Can Shop For</h3> <p>Services You Can Shop For are good to know, but this is an estimate. These costs can vary from lender to lender based on how they estimate these fees for you.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-7-services-you-can-shop-for-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-7-services-you-can-shop-for-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>Most are self-explanatory, but we'll briefly break them down for you here:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Pest Inspection Fee</strong> is to have the </span><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-home-inspection" style="font-weight: normal;">home inspected</a><span style="font-weight: normal;"> for hard to find pests</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Survey Fee</strong> is to confirm that the property lines match what is on file with the county</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Title - Insurance Binder</strong> is a temporary form of real estate insurance coverage related to the transfer of ownership</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Title - Lender's Title Policy</strong> is to protect the lender against any title dispute that comes up in the future</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Title - Settlement Agent Fee</strong> is for your escrow or closing agent who gathers and disburses all documents and money from buyer and seller in the transaction</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Title - Title Search</strong> is to research and confirm that the property legally belongs to the owner and they have rights to sell it to you</span></li> </ul> <p>These are important when comparing quotes if the total number varies by a lot of money. If they differ slightly, don't worry. They're just estimates.</p> <p>All of those fees will be consistent across the board when you close on the house, no matter what lender you close.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Loan Costs - D. Total Loan Costs</h3> <p>This section adds up the totals from A, B, and C.</p> <h3><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-8-total-loan-costs-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-8-total-loan-costs-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></h3> <h3>Other Costs - E. Taxes and Other Government Fees</h3> <p>The right-hand column lists your Taxes and Other Government Fees similar to your other costs.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-9-taxes-and-government-fees-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-9-taxes-and-government-fees-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>The listed elements and what they mean are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Recording Fees</strong> and other taxes get paid to the county for recording the sale as public record</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Transfer Taxes</strong> go to the county for the transfer of the deed from the seller to the buyer</li> </ul> <p>These costs will be the same when you close, no matter the lender.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Other Costs - F. Prepaids</h3> <p>Section F includes your Prepaids. These are estimated costs that you have to pay up-front.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-10-prepaids-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-10-prepaids-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>These include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Homeowner's Insurance Premium</strong> is the number of months of homeowners insurance payments that are due up-front</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Mortgage Insurance Premium</strong> is the number of months of mortgage insurance payments that are due up-front</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Prepaid Interest</strong> is the number of days of interest that is due up-front, accounting for the day you close until the end of the month</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Property Taxes</strong> is the number of months of property tax payments that are due up-front</li> </ul> <p>Again, don't worry about the exact dollar amount in this section because these are only estimates, and they're going to vary from lender to lender.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Other Costs - G. Initial Escrow Payment at Closing</h3> <p>The Initial Escrow at Closing section is money due at closing, similar to the Prepaids in the previous section.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, these are different than Prepaids because they go towards setting up your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-escrow">escrow</a> account, which allows you to pay these costs monthly as part of your mortgage payment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Escrow accounts ensure you won't be surprised by significant lump-sum payments and make for easy budgeting.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-11-initial-escrow-payment-at-closing-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-11-initial-escrow-payment-at-closing-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>Some of the line items you'll see here include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Homeowner’s Insurance</strong> protects the home and its contents against unexpected damage and events</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Mortgage Insurance</strong> allows you to buy a home with less than 20 percent down</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Property Taxes</strong> are the taxes paid to the county or state for owning your home</li> </ul> <h3>Other Costs - H. Other</h3> <p>The Other section includes costs that don't fit in sections A-H. These might consist of title fees like the "Title - Owner's Title Policy" that you see in the screenshot.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-12-title-owner-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-12-title-owner-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>An Owner's Title Policy protects the buyer against any title dispute in the future.</p> <h3>Other Costs - H. Total Other Costs</h3> <p>Your Total Other Costs section adds sections E-H.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-13-total-other-costs-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-13-total-other-costs-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p>When comparing quotes, make sure that this number is close. It doesn't have to be an exact match because they are estimated. And when you close, all the costs are going to be the same no matter what lender you go with&nbsp;</p> <p>That's not something you're going to negotiate over.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Other Costs - J. Total Closing Costs</h3> <p>The Total Closing Costs section is your Total Other Costs, plus your Total Loan Costs, minus any lender credits you may receive.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-14-total-closing-costs-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-14-total-closing-costs-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <h3>Calculating Cash to Close</h3> <p>Calculating cash to close will be different for every transaction. These differ based on the deposit that you have or haven't put into escrow.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-15-calculating-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-15-calculating-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Estimated Cash to Close</strong> shows you how much total money will come out-of-pocket (including your down payment) when you're buying the home.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="font-family: circular-bold, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;"><strong>Tip: </strong></span>Don't get caught up in estimated figures. It's good for you to know so you can have a ballpark of how much money it's going to take to buy the house. But when comparison shopping, those estimates aren't that important.</p> <h2>Loan Estimate: Page Three Simplified</h2> <p>You'll find additional information about the lender moving to the third page.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-16-additional-information-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-16-additional-information-1" width="737" loading="lazy" style="width: 737px;"></p> <p>This page includes your mortgage expert's company name, licensing information, and contact info.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Comparisons</h3> <p>Then there's your Comparison section. This section shows you three items with simple explanations of each.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-17-comparisons-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-17-comparisons-1" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>In 5 Years </strong>is the total you have paid in principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs. Then, just the principal</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Annual Percentage Rate</strong>&nbsp;is your total costs over the loan term expressed as a rate. Note that this is not your interest rate</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Total Interest Percentage</strong> is the total amount of interest you will pay over the loan term as a percentage of your loan amount</li> </ul> <p>Although this is the comparison section, they are estimated figures, so we don't recommend using them in comparison shopping.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you must use one of these fields, use the in five years field because that's the most user-friendly and a decent barometer.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Other Considerations</h3> <p>The Other Considerations section includes special information relevant to your loan. This will look different depending on the type of loan you choose or how much money you put down.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-18-other-considerations-1.png" alt="loan-estimate-18-other-considerations-1" width="1436" loading="lazy" style="width: 1436px;"></p> <p>Based on this loan estimate example, here’s a breakdown of what each refers to.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Appraisals</strong>&nbsp;help determine the value of your home and are required for any home purchase</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Assumption</strong>&nbsp;lets the lender specify whether or not this loan, and its terms, can be transferred to another person if you sell the property&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Homeowner’s insurance</strong> is usually required when buying a home so the home, and its contents, are protected against unexpected events&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Late Payment</strong> is like a phone bill or water bill; you’ll incur late fees if you do not pay on time. The specific fees might differ from what you see in the example</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Refinance</strong>&nbsp;is the process of replacing your current mortgage loan with a new one. There are certain elements that might affect whether or not you are eligible for a refinance, such as volatile market conditions, property value fluctuations or changes in your finances</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Servicing</strong> refers to collecting and tracking your loan payments. In the example, there are checkboxes with the option for the lender to service the loan or to transfer the servicing to a third party</li> </ul> <h2>Loan Estimate Example</h2> <p>You can see the full <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/loan-estimate/" rel="noopener">loan estimate example from the Consumer Finance</a> site or look below.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/Loan%20Estimate.png" alt="Loan Estimate" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-page-2.png" alt="loan-estimate-page-2" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></p> <h2><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/loan-estimate-page-3.png" alt="loan-estimate-page-3" width="747" loading="lazy" style="width: 747px;"></h2> <h2>What to Look Out For With Your Loan Estimate</h2> <p>In every loan estimate, there are some things to look out for. The most important is the aforementioned tip to make sure your loan estimate is formatted in the same way as the Consumer Finance's example. Also, these are estimates, so they may change.</p> <p>And because these are estimates, be wary of the following:</p> <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lenders might underestimate</span></h3> <p>There are lenders out there who may not be the most "borrower first." Lenders may purposely underestimate these costs, especially taxes, insurances, and mortgage insurance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Underestimating these costs can make their quote look far better than it will be when it comes to closing time.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Lenders might overestimate</h3> <p>Other lenders may purposefully overestimate these costs, knowing that you might ask for lower ones. That way, when it comes time to close the loan, they get to be the hero and provide some good news.</p> <p>Both of those things are terrible for comparison shopping, and they're even worse for your budgeting. You want accurate figures. At Homebuyer and plenty of other lenders, these costs get estimated as close to 100 percent accurate as possible.</p> <p>Remember that numbers are never exact upfront. Don't worry about any estimated fees that your lender doesn't dictate.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How to Compare Mortgage Loan Estimates</h2> <p>Concentrate on the top left section of page two of the loan estimate when comparing rates. This section is what the lender has control over.</p> <p>It doesn't matter what the origination charges are. It doesn't matter how they get itemized. It doesn't matter what the lender labels them as. The only thing that matters is the total amount of origination charges you're paying and the services you cannot shop for.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you look above, you have $1,802 in origination charges and $672 in services you cannot shop for. That's a total of $2,474. The $2,474 is how much the lender is charging to give a rate of 3.875%. That rate gets listed at the top of page one, in the Loan Terms section.</p> <p>This $2,474 is what it's going to cost you in loan fees. The lender doesn't control the prices and costs for anything else.</p> <h2>How to Get Lower Loan Costs</h2> <p>It is possible to get $0 in loan costs, but your interest rate may be higher. Most lenders will give you the option to pay less money out-of-pocket in exchange for a higher interest rate. This option typically results in the buyer receiving a lender credit for the amount of their closing costs.</p> <p>Conversely, you may be able to pay more money upfront for a lower interest rate and a lower monthly payment.</p> <p>The choice is yours, and it comes down to your goals and preferences. Be sure to ask your lender if these options would be available to you.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>We believe that you should be the most educated and prepared home buyer possible. To understand a loan estimate and compare quotes from different lenders, focus on the most critical variables: loan costs and interest rates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Isolating these makes a loan estimate easier to read and allows you to make a confident decision when working with your lender.&nbsp;</p> <p>We always recommend comparing rates from multiple lenders before committing to one. The first deal you find might not be the best one for you.</p> <p>And remember, if you ever have any questions, ask them in the chat. We're here to help.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p>]]></post_content>

Research Your Local Housing Market and Mortgage News</h2> <p>Read up on current housing trends and home sales to get a feel for the real estate market before you dive in. If the market’s competitive, decide if you want to wait to buy or prepare a game plan with your real estate agent to improve your offer to buy.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to become familiar with current rates and housing prices to help you prepare a budget, anticipate negotiations, and create a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/timeline-for-buying-a-house/"><span>home buying timeline</span></a>.

Stick To Your Budget</h2> <p>Create an accurate budget and stick to it to maintain your finances. Know how much home you can comfortably afford and don’t budge on that number when you submit an offer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Going over budget on your house isn’t a one-time expense. It can impact your monthly mortgage payments, your down payment, and your insurance premiums. Stick to a monthly payment you can afford to support your financial and mental health.</p> <a id="positiveMindset" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>6. Maintain a Positive Mindset</h2> <p>You’ve decided to buy a home for a reason, and there are hundreds of things that may excite you about homeownership. Whether you want to plant the garden of your dreams and enjoy <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/curb-appeal-ideas"><span>beautiful curb appeal</span></a>, or you can’t wait to never make a rent payment again, make a list of your top homeownership benefits.</p> <p>Refer to the list throughout the process, and add new items as they appear to maintain your enthusiasm and motivation.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/3-tips-to-soothe-home-buying-stress-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration of a woman jogging says &quot;yoga, mindfulness, and nature walks have positive effects on stress, anxiety and depression.&quot;"></p> <a id="buyAHome" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Prepare To Buy a Home</h2> <p>Every homeowner was once a first-time buyer who learned new home buying terminology, dug deep into their finances, and hired a home buying team they trusted. All you need is a little preparation, and you’re ready to start your home buying journey.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/1-tips-to-soothe-home-buying-stress-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="&quot;90% of first-time home buyers are happy with their home purchase.&quot;"></p> <h3>Prioritize Your Relationships</h3> <p>Choosing a house that your whole family will love is a practice in communication and patience. From the <span>house style</span> and size to the neighborhood and school district, there are a lot of variables to rank when buying a home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Start your journey by including everyone in the conversation and identify your must-haves for the house. Browse a couple of homes online for inspiration, and discuss what features you want to prioritize as a family.&nbsp;</p> <p>A home purchase plan from the beginning will help direct your search and support discussions when it’s time to submit an offer or pass.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Healthy Habit:</strong> Schedule quality time together each week to enjoy a fun activity and talk about movies, music, and joy rather than the house hunt.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Prepare for Competition</h3> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house"><span>Submitting an offer</span></a> on a home may come with some competition, and it can be humbling to find a home you love and lose your bid. The good news is that you can try again, and you’ll be better prepared for the decision.</p> <p>Your real estate agent will be an excellent asset in drafting an attractive offer and negotiating with the seller’s agent. You can even pre-prepare the letter details so you’re ready to make an offer as soon as you find a house you love.</p> <p><strong>Healthy Habit: </strong>Write gratitude notes that promote positivity if your offer is rejected. You may be thankful that you can try for a house with a larger yard, or grateful that you have a better idea of what your dream house looks like.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Understand the Financials</h3> <p>Buying a house is a significant purchase that requires some up-front cash to cover your down payment, closing costs, plus home and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi"><span>private mortgage insurance</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buying a home is an investment that builds equity and contributes to your wealth. You can convert this investment into cash for repairs, sell for a profit, or upgrade your home once you build enough equity.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/2-tips-to-soothe-home-buying-stress-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Calculator illustration states &quot;85% of homeowners are satisfied with their house cost — 37% higher than renters' satisfaction.&quot;"></p> <p>The key is getting your finances prepared early. Know exactly how much you want to put down, how much house you can afford, and if you have any cash gifts to support your purchase. Commit to these numbers so you don’t have to worry about breaking your budget when you write your offer letter.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re saving for a down payment, consult with your lender to understand what <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/low-down-payment-mortgage"><span>low down payment home loan</span></a> options are available to you.</p> <p><strong>Healthy Habit: </strong>Build a budget you’re confident in and stick to it. You know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnOhoqpg7aw&amp;ab_channel=Homebuyer"><span>how much you can afford</span></a> and how much you can pay each month — your broker doesn’t.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Do Your Due Diligence</h3> <p>Research ahead of time to determine your budget, what <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span>style of house</span></a> you like, and your neighborhood preferences. Once you begin the house hunt, take notes about what features you like and don’t like, and any concerns you see that you want to bring up.&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, you may notice one house has drafty single-pane windows that you’d like to update. Even if you don’t make an offer on that house, you can start to take a closer look at the windows installed in other homes.</p> <p>Most buyers have the home inspected once their offer is accepted, and this can help you spot some of these updates and repairs. Home inspections allow you to make sure the home is <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move-in ready</span></a> without major alterations.&nbsp;</p> <p>If your home inspector finds structural damage or required repairs, you have options to negotiate or exit the deal.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="howDoes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How Does Mortgage Pre-approval Work?</h2> <p>A pre-approval works by using verified information to approve you, as a buyer, for a mortgage loan. You should always contact a lender to see what loan amount you can qualify for before house hunting.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>A mortgage expert will review your financial documents and use the information to determine what you are eligible for, go over your loan options, and provide a detailed estimate, including interest rate, closing costs, and your monthly housing payment.</p> <p>All the information they review in the pre-approval process determines the mortgage amount and interest rate you qualify for currently.&nbsp;</p> <p>The pre-approval reviews details like:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score</li> <li aria-level="1">Credit history</li> <li aria-level="1">Monthly debt payments</li> <li aria-level="1">Bank statements&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Pay stubs</li> <li aria-level="1">Tax returns</li> <li aria-level="1">Housing payment history</li> </ul> <p>Your pre-approval is typically good for 90 days. The mortgage and interest rate they provide give you a reliable amount to work with for your house hunting. It enables you to forecast your mortgage payments and accurately calculate the maximum property value you want to afford.</p> <a id="whatsThe" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What's the Difference Between Pre-approval vs. Pre-qualification?</h2> <p>A pre-approval uses verified information to approve you, as a buyer, for a mortgage loan. A pre-qualification doesn't.</p> <p>A <strong>pre-qualification</strong> uses estimates, not verified information. It's a non-verified estimate of how much a home buyer can qualify for and gives the home buyer an estimate of the interest rate they will be paying on their mortgage.</p> <p>A <strong>pre-approval</strong> is the process where a lender verifies your information and approves you for a mortgage. After completing a pre-approval, you receive a formal document that confirms the mortgage size and interest rate you can obtain from your lender.<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p> <div data-hs-responsive-table="true" style="overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 737px; margin: 0px auto 25px;"> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 544px;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 73px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; background-color: #5462d1; height: 73px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">Pre-qualification</span></p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom; background-color: #5462d1; height: 73px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">Pre-approval</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 74px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 74px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Shows affordability at one point in time</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 74px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Good for 90 days</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 105px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 105px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Provides an early estimate of mortgage affordability</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 105px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Provides written commitment of mortgage affordability</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 106px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 106px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Quoted based on self-attested estimates</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 106px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Quoted based on accurate and verified information&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 106px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 106px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Answer questions about your financial situation</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 106px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Submit documents proving your financial situation</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 74px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 74px; width: 354.422px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Self-reported credit score</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; height: 74px; width: 375.547px; padding: 0px;"> <p>Hard credit inquiry</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>Banks, credit unions, and other lending institutions take precautions before lending money. Lenders pull credit reports to assess an individual's present and historical financial behavior. These assessments divide into categories known as soft inquiries and hard inquiries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Learn more about the <a href="/learn/pre-qualification-vs-pre-approval" rel="noopener">difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval</a>.</p> <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">What's The Difference Between a Hard and a Soft Credit Inquiry?</h3> <p>A hard inquiry is when a lender checks your credit because you applied for a loan. A soft inquiry occurs without a loan application, like when companies send you promotional offers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soft inquiries don't affect credit scores. Hard inquiries will decrease your <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-many-points-does-an-inquiry-drop-your-credit-score/"><span>credit score by five points or less</span></a> and are only affected for a few months.</p> <p><strong>Soft credit inquiry:</strong> Soft inquiries don't impact your credit score. An example of a soft inquiry is an employer conducting a financial background check on a potential new employee candidate.&nbsp;</p> <p>These inquiries don't submit a new credit application, as they are just looking at your overall credit score. You can perform a soft inquiry and look up your credit score.</p> <p><strong>Hard credit inquiry</strong>: When an individual pursues an application for a new loan or line of credit, the lender performs a more in-depth assessment. This assessment looks at the buyer's credit score and credit report to determine if they're suitable for the credit or loan request.&nbsp;</p> <p>This comprehensive assessment looks at an individual's credit history reported by the three main credit bureaus<span style="font-size: 11px;">,</span> <a href="https://www.equifax.com/"><span>Equifax</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><a href="https://www.transunion.com/"><span>TransUnion</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, </span>and <a href="https://www.experian.com/"><span>Experian</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.&nbsp;</span></p> <a id="isPre" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><strong>Is Pre-approval a Hard Inquiry?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, a pre-approval is a hard inquiry. Applying for a pre-approval through a mortgage lender is a standard step in the mortgage approval process because it involves lenders looking at more detailed information.</p> <p>Because lenders give loans for large amounts of money, hard inquiry credit checks are routine.</p> <a id="howLong" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><strong>How Long Will a Pre-approval Impact Your Credit Score?</strong></h2> <p>Because pre-approvals are hard inquiries that impact a home buyer's credit score, they can stay visible on their credit reports for up to two years, according to <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/does-mortgage-prequalification-affect-credit-score/"><span>Experian</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your credit score is one of the most important factors a lender considers. Your lender accesses the score and documentation through credit bureaus.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, the impact on a home buyer's credit score declines as time passes, and the hard inquiry becomes less relevant.&nbsp;</p> <p>Depending on a home buyer's financial history, a few points can impact their credit score. However, many variables make up a home buyer's creditworthiness and can influence the impact of the inquiry.</p> <h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <p>There are clear advantages when getting a pre-approval as a home buyer. After the pre-approval process, you'll receive a conditional commitment for a specified loan amount and mortgage rate.</p> <p>This pre-approval letter shows home sellers that you are a qualified buyer that can afford to purchase their home. Sellers know this and will rarely take an offer seriously if you don't also provide a pre-approval letter. So, if you are serious about <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house"><span>making an offer on a home</span></a>, a pre-approval is a must.</p> <p>Being able to set an accurate budget is another advantage of getting pre-approved. When you know the mortgage amount you are qualified to obtain from a lender, you can make more accurate decisions on which homes you want to afford and see in person. Knowing your mortgage amount, down payment, and monthly payments up-front is an integral part of the house-hunting process.</p> <p>If you have more questions about mortgage pre-approval or want to discuss the best mortgage option for you, connect with us in the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/#hs-chat-open"><span>chat</span></a>.

		<post_date><![CDATA[January 20, 2022]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whatIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What is Mortgage Pre-qualification?</h2> <p>Mortgage pre-qualification helps lenders understand how much you can borrow by asking you a few questions about your finances.</p> <!--more--> <p>For example, they'll ask about your income and whether or not you have a down payment saved up. Lenders may also ask for basic information about your credit score and monthly debts.</p> <p>Once they review this information, lenders will offer you a quote without verifying the info you gave them, or looking further into your income, investments, and assets.</p> <p>Because it's based on estimated figures only, pre-qualification is generally quicker than pre-approval.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>But keep in mind that your pre-qualification estimate isn't factual.</strong> It's just an idea of how much you can borrow. The actual number typically changes once the lender runs credit and verifies your financial documents.</p> <p>You can use a pre-qualification as a guide to determine your price range, but not much more. These can be useful for buyers who aren't serious about buying a home in the near future.</p> <a id="whatIsMortgage" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What is Mortgage Pre-approval?</h2> <p>Mortgage pre-approval is a more robust indicator of your ability to secure a home loan. It goes a step beyond pre-qualification by looking at your credit, verifying your financial documents, and making you stand out among other home buyers when it's time to make an offer.</p> <p>With pre-approval, lenders pull a <a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/report/understanding-hard-inquiries-on-your-credit-report/" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>hard inquiry</span></a> on your credit report and verify each source of income that you list on the loan application. These include your pay stubs, W-2 statements, and, in some cases, your 1099s and tax returns.&nbsp;</p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Tip</strong>: Hard credit inquiries will only lower your score by five points or less. Your score will also come back up after a few months as long as you maintain regular credit best practices. <br><br><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-many-points-does-an-inquiry-drop-your-credit-score/">Experian</a></p> <p>Learn more about <a href="/learn/does-pre-approval-affect-credit-score" rel="noopener">how getting pre-approved for a mortgage affects your credit score</a>.</p> <p>A pre-approval allows lenders to determine your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-debt-to-income-dti" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>debt-to-income ratio</span></a>, which tells them exactly how much you can borrow. Along with that approval, you'll get an itemized estimate of interest rates, closing costs, monthly payments, and the maximum amount you're approved to buy.</p> <p>By giving you a pre-approval, the lender is saying you’re a fully approved buyer. When you find a home, and it’s time to get your mortgage, the lender only needs to approve the property you’re buying before issuing your full mortgage approval.</p> <p>One big advantage pre-approval has over pre-qualification is that it can be the difference between getting an approved offer on a home or losing it to another buyer. Sellers and their agents know that pre-approvals mean more than pre-qualifications, and they’ll rarely look at an offer that doesn’t include a pre-approval letter.</p> <a id="whatsThe" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What's the Difference Between Pre-approval and Pre-qualification?</h2> <p>Pre-approval is a more in-depth process where lenders verify your credit and financial information before giving you a detailed loan estimate. Pre-qualification relies on self-reported information without taking any additional verification steps.</p> <p>Here's a side-by-side comparison:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 477px; vertical-align: middle;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 87px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; background-color: #5462d1; text-align: center; width: 346.938px; height: 87px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px;">Pre-qualification</span></p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; background-color: #5462d1; text-align: center; width: 366.047px; height: 87px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px;">Pre-approval</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 96px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; width: 346.938px; height: 96px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p>Does not require financial verification</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; width: 366.047px; height: 96px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p>Requires financial verification</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 121px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; width: 346.938px; height: 121px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p>Self-reported information used but not verified</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; width: 366.047px; height: 121px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p>Credit check and supporting financial documentation required</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 137px;"> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; text-align: center; width: 346.938px; height: 137px; vertical-align: bottom; padding: 4px;"> <p>Can be useful in determining your home budget</p> </td> <td style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center; width: 366.047px; height: 137px; padding: 4px;"> <p>Is more accurate for budgeting and is required to make a serious offer on a home</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As you can see, pre-qualification doesn't consider any verified documentation, meaning it doesn't get you any closer to getting a mortgage.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, pre-approval means more to sellers, as it requires lenders to verify your financial information and approve you — the buyer — for a mortgage. Plus, it will pinpoint your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/tricks-for-home-buyer-budget" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>home-buying budget.</span></a></p> <p>The end goal is to get a full mortgage approval, not a full mortgage qualification. We always advise starting with a pre-approval because they are more accurate, give you more information, and are part of the mortgage process.</p> <p>Pre-approvals mean more to sellers and allow you to fast-forward the mortgage process when you find a home you love.</p> <a id="whatDo" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Do You Need to Get Pre-approved?&nbsp;</h2> <p>To get pre-approved, you'll need to provide the lender with supporting financial documents. This differs from the pre-qualification process in that the lender will take a much closer look into your financial profile before offering you a mortgage loan.</p> <p>Here's a snapshot of what you need to get pre-approved versus pre-qualified:</p> <div data-hs-responsive-table="true" style="overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 737px; margin: 0px auto 25px;"> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; vertical-align: middle; height: 509px;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 94px;"> <td style="border: 0.75pt solid #808080; width: 349.125px; height: 94px; vertical-align: bottom; background-color: #5462d1;"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Pre-qualification Requirements</span></p> </td> <td style="border: 0.75pt solid #808080; width: 380.875px; height: 94px; vertical-align: bottom; background-color: #5462d1;"> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Pre-approval Requirements</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 81px;"> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 81px; width: 349.125px;"> <p>No credit inquiry</p> </td> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 81px; width: 380.875px;"> <p>“Hard” credit inquiry</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 132px; text-align: center;"> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 132px; width: 349.125px;"> <p>Self-reported income information like income, debts, assets, etc.</p> </td> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 132px; width: 380.875px;"> <p>Verified income information with supporting documentation</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 103px; text-align: center;"> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 103px; width: 349.125px;"> <p>No additional verification required</p> </td> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 103px; width: 380.875px;"> <p>Financial documentation required, like bank account statements or most recent W-2&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 84px;"> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 84px; width: 349.125px;"> <p>Down payment amount</p> </td> <td style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; vertical-align: bottom; height: 84px; width: 380.875px;"> <p>Down payment amount</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>The above snapshot isn't one-size-fits-all. Lenders may differ in what documents they require and what tools they use in the pre-approval process.</p> <p>For example, some lenders may require a paper application and actual signatures, while others may offer a more streamlined approach with an online application and e-signatures.</p> <a id="howLong" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Long Does Pre-qualification or Pre-approval Take?</h2> <p>Pre-qualification can happen in minutes but can take up to a couple of days. Pre-approval can also happen quickly and can take longer depending on the lender, sometimes as long as seven to ten business days.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Homebuyer, our process takes just three minutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p> <a id="whyIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Why is Pre-approval For a Mortgage So Important?</h2> <p>A mortgage pre-approval is essential because it ensures that you are on the same page with your lender and are ready to do some serious house hunting. That's why it's important to get <a href="/learn/get-pre-approved-before-looking" rel="noopener">pre-approved for a mortgage before looking for your home</a>.</p> <p>Many buyers are pre-approved for more than they want to spend. The detailed loan estimate provided will show your interest rate, closing cost, and monthly payment information, which helps you dial in your personal budget and make a more confident offer on a home.</p> <p>This transparency also makes it easier to determine how much you should bid or offer on a home for sale, and it allows you to make the best decision possible when putting in an offer.</p> <p>When the time comes to submit your offer, a pre-approval letter will let the seller know you’re a serious, qualified buyer.</p> <a id="isA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Is a Pre-approval Letter the Same as Applying For a Loan?</h2> <p>No, pre-approval means that the lender has vetted your financial documents, verified your income, assets, and credit, and is confident that you would receive final approval for a loan.</p> <p>While a pre-approval letter is evidence of the lender's confidence in your ability to handle a mortgage, you’ll still contact your mortgage expert to have your pre-approval converted to a formal loan application once you have an accepted offer.</p> <a id="whenIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>When Is the Best Time to Get Pre-approved?</h2> <p>The best time to get pre-approved is as early as possible. It shows that you're a serious buyer and are financially capable of closing on a home, providing confidence to sellers.</p> <p>If you’re not planning on buying in the near future, still get pre-approved. The itemized loan estimate provides valuable information for budgeting and financial planning leading up to your purchase.</p> <p><a href="/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for" rel="noopener">Pre-approvals are good for</a> 90 days. If you’re not going to buy in that time period, just contact your lender to have your pre-approval refreshed when you get closer to house hunting.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is the best way to go, no matter where you are in the home buying process.</p> <p>As opposed to pre-qualification, pre-approval doesn't rely on self-reported information to secure a mortgage loan. With additional verifications, it assures real estate agents and sellers that you're a strong candidate for a home.</p> <p>Although pre-approvals are a more involved process than pre-qualification, it's worth it in the end because they’re more accurate, more detailed, and they set you up for home buying success</p> <p>Happy homebuying!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h2>1. Home Values Are High&nbsp;</h2> <p>Home values are a huge reason to buy a home, especially if you plan to stay long-term.</p> <!--more--> <p>The market is hot and values are high. And with more buyers than there are homes for sale, it seems that they won't be plummeting anytime soon.&nbsp;</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 737px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.31%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.31%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh0RPJdjazo" width="737" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh0RPJdjazo" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But this is nothing new. Historically, long-term home prices have been going up. There have been a few fluctuations along the timeline, but they've happened quickly and eventually corrected themselves.</p> <p>These rising home prices are why homeownership is the most powerful wealth-building tool in the country. It's a reason to buy, not wait.&nbsp;</p> <p>In some areas, some <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/places-where-pay-raises-dramatically-trail-home-price-gains/"><span>home prices are outpacing income rates</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Are High Home Prices a Reason to Wait?</h3> <p>High home prices aren't necessarily a reason to wait to buy a home. Although this is our number one reason to buy a home right now, some people think you'll save a bunch of money if you wait for prices to drop.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, in the last 10 years, the most significant change in home prices over three months has been an increase of 6% or a decrease of 5%.</p> <p>Those percentages translate into a lot of dollars. And if those historic swings repeat, it would make mortgage payments go up or down by about $50 a month on a $200,000 home. But home prices don't have to dip.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's as much of a chance that they stay the same or increase.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plus, home prices aren't the only thing that affects your monthly payment.</p> <p>Don't forget about interest rates.</p> <h2>2. Interest Rates Are Low&nbsp;</h2> <p>Low rates are another reason to buy a home right now. Rates are almost as low as they've ever been.</p> <p>When interest rates are low, it means you can buy a more expensive house without considerable jumps in your monthly payment. Low rates mean higher levels of affordability.</p> <p>Affordability doesn't mean the purchase price of a home. It relates to your monthly payment. And interest rates affect affordability more than anything.</p> <p>Read on if you want to see how much interest rates affect your monthly payment compared to home prices.</p> <h3>How Interest Rates Affect Monthly Payments and Home Prices</h3> <p>Home prices aren't the only thing that rise and fall. Not only do rates move faster than home prices, but they affect your bottom line a lot more.</p> <p>The most significant rise in interest rates we've seen in the last 10 years is 1% in a three-month period.</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 737px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.31%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.31%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/221v4_cL-Y8" width="737" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/221v4_cL-Y8" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Remember that $50 a month payment change from earlier due to home prices?</p> <p>1% might not sound high, but an interest rate change like this would raise your payment by almost $120 a month on that $200,000 home.</p> <p>If you're pre-approved at a rate that gives you a monthly payment you're comfortable with, it might be a good idea to stop waiting.</p> <h2>How to Buy a House in 2022 With No Down Payment</h2> <p>If you're waiting to buy a home because the down payment is holding you back, you're not alone. It's one of the main hurdles facing new home buyers. Some are taking drastic measures to cut costs, like taking funds out of retirement savings or paying down debt with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-than-1-in-10-first-time-home-buyers-sold-crypto-to-fund-down-payments-heres-what-to-know-before-you-do-it-11641598347"><span>cryptocurrency</span></a>.</p> <p>Before you consider that, many <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/low-down-payment-mortgage"><span>low down payment mortgage options</span></a> are available for first-time home buyers.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are also ways to <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money"><span>buy a house with no money</span></a>.

They have higher FICO score requirements than some government-backed loans.</p> <!--more--> <p>Buyers have no restrictions on the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span>house styles</span></a> they can purchase or property location. Buyers can manage their property taxes and insurance independently and choose to open an escrow account to group these costs with monthly mortgage payments as they prefer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house/"><span>what you need to buy a house</span></a>.</p> <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">What's needed?</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score: 620+</li> <li aria-level="1">Down payment: 3 percent</li> </ul> <h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Is mortgage insurance required?</span></h3> <p>Mortgage insurance is required for buyers financing more than 80 percent of their home purchase.

Buyers who make a 10 percent down payment or more are eligible with a score as low as 500. Buyers can also use down payment assistance from Homebuyer.com to cover their down payment and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house"><span>make an offer on a house</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">What's needed?</h3> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score: 580+</li> <li aria-level="1">Down payment: 3.5 percent</li> </ul> <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Is mortgage insurance required?</h3> <p>Mortgage insurance is required, regardless of the down payment.

Both programs require buyers to have a credit score of 640 or higher.</p> <p>Middle-income earners or lower can secure the second loan with no monthly payments or interest charges. The 3.5 percent second loan covers your down payment and is forgivable after 36 months of consecutive, on-time payments.</p> <p>The 5 percent down payment assistance loan covers your down payment and a large portion of your closing costs. The 5 percent loan is forgivable after 10 years of payments that don’t fall more than 60 days behind.&nbsp;</p> <p>High-income earners can qualify for this assistance, as well. There will be a monthly payment and you have two options to choose from.</p> <p>Both the 3.5 percent and 5 percent loans offer a 10-year loan with 0 percent interest or a 30-year loan with 5 percent interest.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down payment assistance typically has income and credit history requirements.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whichLoans" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Which Loans Are 100 Percent Mortgage Financing Home Loans?</h2> <p>USDA and VA loans don’t require a down payment, so you can purchase a home with 100 percent mortgage financing. Each of these loan types have specific requirements for qualification.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--><h3>USDA Loans</h3> <p>You can qualify for a USDA mortgage if:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">You have a credit score of 620 or higher</li> <li aria-level="1">You’re purchasing a home in an <a href="https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do;jsessionid=QAIsyA-ViDiHjnL2zl0pye7g" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>eligible location</span></a></li> <li aria-level="1">You’ll live in the home you’re purchasing</li> </ul> <h3>VA Loans</h3> <p>VA loans are available for service members and their spouses if:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">You qualify for a <a href="https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/home-buying-process/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Certificate of Eligibility (COE)</span></a> from the VA</li> <li aria-level="1">The home you choose meets <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26-07/Ch12_Minimum_Property_Requirement_NEW.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>VA minimum property requirements</span></a></li> </ul> <p>Buyers who don’t qualify for zero-down payment loans can still finance their home purchase with down payment assistance.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/qualifications-for-no-down-payment-mortgages-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration shows requirements to qualify for a USDA and VA mortgage loan."></p> <h3>Down Payment Assistance For Low-Down Payment Mortgages</h3> <p>Down payment assistance programs provide grants and no- or low-interest loans to cover your down payment, closing costs, and other home-buying expenses. This means you can buy a house without paying out of pocket.&nbsp;</p> <p>Renters prove they can afford housing payments when they pay rent, but saving for a down payment prevents many renters from buying a home. Down payment assistance removes this barrier and allows people to purchase a home, lock in their monthly payment, and eliminate future rent increases.</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you rent a home, <span style="font-weight: normal;">you can likely afford regular mortgage payments, but a large down payment may be a barrier to homeownership. Down payment assistance clears that barrier for access to the largest wealth-building tool in the country: homeownership.</span></p> <p>Homebuyer.com offers down payment assistance to first-time home buyers with an FHA mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Buyers can choose between a 3.5 percent second loan to cover the down payment, or a 5 percent second loan that can cover the down payment and closing costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down payment assistance programs typically have credit history and income requirements. Programs for first-time home buyers may also require completion of a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/start"><span>mortgage education course</span></a>.</p> <a id="closingCostsForANoDownPaymentLoan" data-hs-anchor="true"></a><a id="closingCosts" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Costs For a No Down Payment Loan</h2> <p>Buyers are responsible for closing costs, like <a href="/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee" rel="noopener">origination fees</a>, prepaid expenses, and mortgage insurance which average 1-2 percent of the home’s purchase price. There are opportunities to have some of these expenses covered by the seller or your lender.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/5-percent-second-loan-through-chenoa-fund-png.png" loading="lazy"></p> <p>Some down payment assistance funds can apply to closing costs, too.

Here are answers to the most common questions from buyers:</p> <h3>Do banks provide 100 percent mortgage financing?</h3> <p>Many lenders, banks included, will grant 100 percent financing for applicable mortgages. Each lender has their own requirements, but you’ll typically need a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score</span></a> of 580 or higher to qualify for 100 percent mortgages, like VA and USDA mortgages.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consult with your lender to learn what mortgage types you qualify for, and what down payment assistance programs are available.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Is 100 percent financing a good idea?</h3> <p>100 percent mortgage financing is smart when you want to keep as much cash in the bank as possible. It can be risky to deplete your entire savings to cover a down payment.&nbsp;</p> <p>A good rule of thumb is to have six months’ worth of income saved in case of illness, job loss, or other emergencies.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trade-off of buying a home without a down payment is that your loan amount will be larger.

Most of the time, though, you can qualify with a below-average score.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>Credit requirements</span></a> vary by loan type and lender, but buyers can qualify with a score as low as 580.</p> <p>FICO scores fall on a scale between 300-850, and the <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/consumer-credit-review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>national average</span></a> is 710.&nbsp; But some mortgage programs don’t have a credit score requirement at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having a lower credit score doesn’t automatically disqualify you from getting a loan. Since lower credit scores represent risk to lenders, you may be able to qualify by offsetting risk in other ways, like adding a co-signer or providing a higher down payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Not sure how your credit looks? Consumers are entitled to a free credit report annually. Check yours at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>AnnualCreditReport.com</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <a id="incomeRequirements" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Income Requirements To Buy a House</h2> <p>There are no set income requirements to buy a house, and your monthly income isn’t the only determining factor. To buy a home, you will need to provide lenders the following:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Proof of employment</li> <li aria-level="1">Financial history&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Monthly income</li> <li aria-level="1">Debts</li> </ul> <p>If you’re a salaried employee, proof of income means showing pay stubs and a year-end W-2 statement. If you’re self-employed, you’ll need to show tax returns and evidence of your business. If you have a job offer letter but haven’t started work yet, you’ll need proof of the job offer signed by all parties.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to your financial history, lenders are simply looking for a pattern of paying bills mostly on time.</p> <p>Your monthly income and debt will be viewed together to establish your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which compares how much you make with how much you spend. If you spend $30 of every $100 you make on your housing payment and credit debts, your DTI would be 30 percent.</p> <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-debt-to-income-ratio-why-is-the-43-debt-to-income-ratio-important-en-1791/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-debt-to-income-ratio-why-is-the-43-debt-to-income-ratio-important-en-1791/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>ratio under 43 percent</span></a>. Some lenders may still approve borrowers with a DTI up to 50 percent, and sometimes more, depending on&nbsp; compensating factors. For example, having more money in savings, adding a co-signer, or providing a larger down payment will improve your chances.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Low income or student loan debt won’t prevent your approval. You will need a history of paying bills mostly on time and job-related income that gets reported to the IRS.&nbsp;</p> <a id="cashNeeded" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Cash Needed to Close On Your Home</h2> <p>Many people think you need a 20 percent down payment to close on a home, but that’s not true. The typical down payment for first-time home buyers is <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-11-11-2021.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>about 7 percent</span></a>, but some programs can help you buy a home with as little as 3 percent or <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money"><span>no down payment</span></a> at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>USDA and VA loans have no down payment minimums. Low- and no-down payment mortgages are available to homeowners with all credit scores. These loans are best for home buyers with a reliable income and not much money saved up.</p> <p>Down payment assistance (DPA) programs can also help you cover closing costs. Most first-time home buyers spend around 1-2 percent of the home’s purchase price in closing costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, <a href="https://www.homebuyer.com/learn/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>how much money do you need to buy a home?</span></a> Assuming a home sale price of $350,000 with a down payment of 3 percent and closing costs of 1.5 percent, you could purchase your first home with as little as $15,750. If you utilize a <a href="https://youtu.be/fHnkr9GGDkk"><span>down payment assistance program</span></a>, you could buy this home with $0 out of pocket.</p> <a id="buildA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Build a Budget Before You Buy</h2> <p>Home buyer competition can be fierce. The buyers who win are the buyers who prepare. Knowing how much you want to spend on housing each month puts you in a powerful position — you’ll know when to push and when to move on to another home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Budget for all steps of the home-buying process, including:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">How much you want to contribute to a down payment</li> <li aria-level="1">Expected closing costs</li> <li aria-level="1">Your preferred monthly mortgage payments</li> </ul> <p>Once you’ve estimated your budget, set or adjust savings goals as necessary. Remember that your monthly mortgage payment includes five factors, commonly referred to as PITIA:&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Principal</strong> — your mortgage payment</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Interest</strong> — your borrowing rate</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Tax</strong> — state property taxes&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Insurance</strong> — homeowners insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Association Dues</strong> — fee paid to homeowners association (when applicable)</li> </ol> <p>Only you know how much home you can afford. Banks will approve you for the maximum amount possible, even if it’s outside the amount you feel comfortable borrowing. Only spend what fits in your budget.&nbsp;</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnOhoqpg7aw" width="747" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnOhoqpg7aw" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <a id="learnAbout" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <br> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Learn About Mortgage Loans</h2> <p><a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-11-11-2021.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Almost 9 out of 10</span></a> home buyers use a mortgage to purchase their home. You probably will too. That’s why it’s important to understand the different mortgage options available to you.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are five primary <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/mortgage-101#mortgage-types"><span>mortgage loan types</span></a>, each with its own set of rules:&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Conventional mortgages:</strong> These loans require a 3 percent down payment and are usually best for those with steady income, some money saved up, and a credit score of 620 or higher.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>FHA mortgages:</strong> These loans require a 3.5 percent down payment and are available to those with lower credit scores.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>USDA mortgages: </strong>Designed to promote homeownership in rural areas, these mortgages are backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>VA mortgages: </strong>Available to current and past U.S. military members, VA loans allow buyers to purchase a home with no down payment.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Portfolio mortgages: </strong>These loans are privately held by lenders, so rules will vary from firm to firm. They typically require better-than-average income and credit.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>Conventional loans are the most popular — 82 percent of first-time home buyers use them.&nbsp;</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LeQrgz0ie3o" width="747" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LeQrgz0ie3o" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <a id="getMortgage" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <br> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Get Mortgage Pre-Approved</h2> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/fast"><span>Mortgage pre-approval</span></a> is a dress rehearsal for your final approval. Savvy home buyers always get pre-approved before house shopping because pre-approvals:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Help you determine how much house you can afford</li> <li aria-level="1">Provide an itemized estimate of all costs involved</li> <li aria-level="1">Allow you to make a serious offer on a home</li> <li aria-level="1">Reveal potential improvements in your application to get you a better mortgage rate and terms&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>During the pre-approval process, lenders review your income, assets, and credit report to determine how much you can borrow and at what rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Typically, <a href="/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for" rel="noopener">pre-approvals are good for <span>90 days</span></a> because your situation may change between the time you get pre-approved and when you make an offer. If you’re coming up on the 90 day expiration date, contact your lender to have it refreshed.&nbsp;</p> <p>You may also hear about getting pre-qualified for a mortgage, which is different than getting pre-approved. Pre-qualifications take estimates and <span>don't typically verify your financial documentation, whereas a pre-approval does</span>.</p> <p>Learn more about<a href="/learn/pre-qualification-vs-pre-approval" rel="noopener"> pre-approvals vs pre-qualifications</a> to make sure you are getting the right type of approval before house hunting.</p> <a id="hireA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Hire a Real Estate Agent</h2> <p>In the United States, a home buyer’s real estate agent is paid for by the seller. It doesn’t cost you to have an agent. Because you aren’t the one footing the bill, you should get the best agent you can find.&nbsp;</p> <p>An experienced real estate agent helps you:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Find homes in your preferred price range and location&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Negotiate with the seller and seller’s agent</li> <li aria-level="1">Draft and <a href="/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house" rel="noopener">submit your offer</a></li> </ul> <p>An agent can make or break your deal, so we recommend spending some time to find the right person. Meet with and interview several agents until you find someone you feel confident can help you find your dream home.&nbsp;</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe loading="lazy" width="747" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPRWbjA3K0g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <br> <p>Be sure to get your own representation. When one agent represents both the buyer and seller, it’s called <a href="https://youtu.be/OIsanutPUio"><span>dual agency</span></a>. Dual agency results in worse service for both buyer and seller and tends to favor the seller, so avoid this at all costs.&nbsp;</p> <a id="findYour" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Find Your Dream Home</h2> <p>You have your pre-approval, a stellar agent, and you know your budget. Now comes the fun part: It’s time to start touring <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/questions-to-ask-at-an-open-house"><span>open houses</span></a> and do some serious house hunting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Home-buying isn’t like car shopping. When you’re shopping for a car, you can find a model you like and request a different color or leather seats. When you’re shopping for a home, it comes the way you see it.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s why it’s important to know your must-haves, nice-to-haves, and deal breakers before viewing homes. Understanding what you can and can’t compromise on will help you know when to jump on a listing and when to walk away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Location is also a key consideration. Scope out the neighborhoods and communities you’re interested in to find a home you’ll love for years to come!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>You don’t need 20 percent down and a credit score in the high 700s to buy a home. By <span>getting pre-approved</span>, avoiding dual agency, and sticking to your budget, you can make yourself a competitive buyer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Want to learn more?

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Many home buyers begin their journey before <a href="https://homebuyer.com/contact"><span>talking to a lender</span></a>. Home-buying begins when you first see yourself as a future homeowner.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>If you’ve browsed houses online or stopped by an open house in person, you’ve started passive home-buying. Homeownership is something you’d like for your future, and knowing the timeline for buying a house will help guide you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s a breakdown of the home-buying timeline so you can prepare and plan your path to homeownership.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Home-Buying Timeline:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#plan-to-buy" rel="noopener">Plan to Buy</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#choose-lender" rel="noopener">Choose a Mortgage Lender</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#pre-approval" rel="noopener">Mortgage Pre-Approval</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#hire-agent" rel="noopener">Hire a Real Estate Agent</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#shop-home" rel="noopener">Start House Hunting</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#make-offer" rel="noopener">Make an Offer</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#loan-processing-underwriting" rel="noopener">Enter Loan Processing</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#closing" rel="noopener">Close On Your Home</a></li> </ul> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How Long Does It Take To Buy a House?</h2> <p>From the active home-buying stage, buyers can find and purchase a home in as little as 15 weeks, and up to eight months. Many people start the passive home buying stage years in advance. Passive home buying is different for everyone, so we won’t count that in our official timeline.</p> <p>Once you decide it’s time to buy a house, your first step is to get a mortgage pre-approval. Buyers can be pre-approved in just one day. Then, the typical <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>buyer tours nine homes</span></a> over eight weeks before finding their ideal house.</p> <p>After you submit an offer and are under contract, it takes an average of <a href="https://static.elliemae.com/pdf/origination-insight-reports/ICE_OIR_AUG2021.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>49 days to close</span></a> and get your keys. With these estimates, you can move into a new home in four months or less.</p> <p>These time frames can vary, as some lenders close quicker, some buyers take longer to choose a home, and some sellers take longer to accept an offer. The home buying timeline ranges from two to six months for most buyers.</p> <p>Here’s every home-buying step you can expect to take, from viewing listings to moving into your new home.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buying-timeline.png" alt="Illustrated timeline shows 4 home-buying phases and the steps for each.&nbsp;" width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <a id="plan-to-buy" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">1. Begin Planning To Buy a Home&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">6+ months in advance</span></strong></p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buying-timeline-1.png" alt="Home-buying timeline highlights the “passive home-buying” phase." width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>Home buyers often consider homeownership years before they’re ready to meet with a lender. This allows buyers to consider what they like in a home and <a href="/start" rel="noopener">learn about the buying process</a>.</p> <p>This is a time to determine your homeownership goals. Do you need more space for a growing family? Some buyers want a <a href="/learn/home-buying-guide-pet-parents" rel="noopener"><span>yard for their pets</span></a> or outdoor hobbies. Others want to invest in a home and build wealth.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your goals can help you decide what kind of home you want and when you’d like to move.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is also a good time to evaluate your finances and build a monthly budget. A specific budget allows you to see how much you want to pay on a monthly mortgage. It also helps you set savings goals for your down payment and closing costs, unless you choose 100 percent financing.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re worried about approval with your current finances, consider <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money"><span>down payment assistance</span></a> options and accessible loan types.&nbsp;</p> <a id="choose-lender" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">2. Choose a Mortgage Lender&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">1+ days</span></strong></p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buying-timeline-2.png" alt="Home-buying timeline highlights the “active home-buying” phase." width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>A <a href="http://homebuyer.com/"><span>mortgage lender</span></a> can help you decide which loan type is right for you. They’ll also help you consider down payment options and strategize to improve your credit score if necessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most first-time home buyers choose a conventional 30-year mortgage. The longer loan term makes homeownership accessible with a lower monthly mortgage payment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buyers who aren’t eligible for a conventional mortgage may consider government-backed loans. FHA loans are a great option for buyers looking for a loan with low-down payment and less restrictive credit score requirements.&nbsp;</p> <p>USDA and VA loans have no down payment or credit score requirements.&nbsp;</p> <a id="pre-approval" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">3. Get a Mortgage Pre-Approval&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">1+ days</span></strong></p> <p>A mortgage pre-approval shows you how much home you qualify for. The best time to get a <a href="/learn/should-i-get-pre-approved-before-looking" rel="noopener">pre-approval is before you start house hunting</a>. This can be two months or a year in advance — whatever makes sense for you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pre-approvals are a dress rehearsal for your mortgage and are necessary to make a serious offer on a home. They typically <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for"><span>expire after 90 days</span></a> and can be refreshed if you don’t find the home you’re looking for in that time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Know that pre-approvals don’t guarantee your mortgage approval or interest rate. After you’re pre-approved, avoid opening new credit lines or making large debt payments that can impact your FICO score.

An experienced real estate agent knows the neighborhoods and provides insights into the local housing market.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your mortgage lender can recommend agents in your area. You can also ask family and friends who they’ve worked with.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s key to get a real estate agent that represents you, instead of a <a href="https://youtu.be/OIsanutPUio"><span>dual agent</span></a> that represents the seller, too. This <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/first-time-home-buyer-mistakes"><span>home buyer mistake</span></a> can prevent both the buyer and seller from having fair representation.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote>“Using the listing agent is like stepping into a courtroom and using the opposing side's legal counsel. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Everyone is entitled to have their own representation, and should.</span>”&nbsp; — Michelle Corsi, <a href="https://stevewrobbel.howardhanna.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Wrobbel team at Howard Hanna </a>via HGTV.</blockquote> <p>Also, home sellers cover all real estate agent fees unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many buyers only meet with one real estate agent, but it’s important to find someone you connect with.

Shop for Your New Home</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">8 weeks</span></strong></p> <p>House hunting can happen quickly, or end up being time consuming.&nbsp;Either way, it’s an exciting time to explore properties until you find your dream home.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s helpful to know what you want ahead of time, refine your home search, and guide your real estate agent. If you’re not sure what your dream home looks like, touring properties can help you set those expectations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Keep a list of your must-haves, nice-to-haves, and deal-breakers. This can save you time touring and helps you make your final housing decision.&nbsp;</p> <a id="make-offer" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">6. Make An Offer&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">1+ days</span></strong></p> <p>Once you find a house you love, your real estate agent will help you <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house"><span>make an offer on the house</span></a>. Decide details like your earnest money deposit and contingencies in advance so your offer letter template is ready to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>An offer letter typically includes:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The name of the seller&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">The address of the property</li> <li aria-level="1">The names of anyone who will be on the title, including yourself</li> <li aria-level="1">The purchase price you’re offering and down payment</li> <li aria-level="1">The earnest money deposit</li> <li aria-level="1">Any contingencies you’d like to include</li> <li aria-level="1">Any concessions you’re requesting from the seller</li> <li aria-level="1">A complete list of fees and closing costs</li> <li aria-level="1">The dates you’d like to close on the home</li> <li aria-level="1">Your preferred <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move-in</span></a> dates</li> <li aria-level="1">A deadline to respond to the offer</li> </ul> <p>Real estate laws vary by location, so you may need additional information. Your real estate agent or attorney can confirm that your offer letter complies with local regulations.</p> <a id="loan-processing-underwriting" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">7. Loan Processing and Underwriting</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">1+ days</span></strong></p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buying-timeline-3.png" alt="Home-buying timeline highlights the “closing process” phase." width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>Loan processors comb through your mortgage application and ensure they have everything needed for full mortgage approval.</p> <p>Next, the application goes to the underwriter for verification. Underwriters look for inconsistencies in your credit report, credit score, and property details. If anything comes up, the underwriter will reach out with questions.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll complete other closing processes during this phase, too.&nbsp;</p> <h3><span>Home Appraisal</span></h3> <p>Home appraisals determine the value of a home with an inspection from a qualified third-party appraiser. Appraisals are required for any home purchase, sale, or refinance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Appraisers perform a visual inspection of the home and collect specific property and housing market data. This can include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Floor plan</li> <li aria-level="1">Square footage</li> <li aria-level="1">Home amenities and features</li> <li aria-level="1">Property’s neighborhood</li> <li aria-level="1">Local housing trends</li> <li aria-level="1">Similar home sales</li> </ul> <p>The appraiser then considers this data to determine the home’s value.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once the appraisal is complete, buyers receive a report detailing the property, neighborhood, and local housing sales.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a home buyer, the appraisal allows you to know your home’s value and can influence the buying process.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the appraisal projects the house is of equal or higher value than the sale price, the home sale continues. If the appraisal finds the home’s value is less than the sale price, the buyer has the opportunity to negotiate.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the seller isn’t willing to negotiate, your mortgage lender is unlikely to approve the mortgage for a higher amount than the home’s worth. At this point, you can walk away from the deal or pay the difference between the appraised value and the purchase price.&nbsp;</p> <h3><span>Home Inspection</span></h3> <p>A home inspection provides insight into the current condition of a home and its features. Home inspections aren’t required, but highly recommended and are often a contingency in your contract.&nbsp;</p> <p>Home inspectors look at the interior and exterior of the home, covering everything from plumbing to the foundation.&nbsp;</p> <p>They don’t look at sewage pipes, behind electrical panels, or inside interior walls.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once finished, the inspector provides a report highlighting:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Safety concerns</li> <li aria-level="1">Major and minor defects</li> <li aria-level="1">Items that need to be replaced</li> <li aria-level="1">Items that need to be repaired&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Items that may need to be repaired</li> </ul> <p>As the buyer, you get to choose if you’d still like to purchase the home given the report’s findings.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you still love the home but don’t want to pay to replace the roof, you have room to negotiate. You can ask that the seller fix the issue or lower the sale price to accommodate the repair.</p> <p>Buyers have seven days after an inspection to decide to purchase or walk away from the sale. If you choose to waive the home inspection contingency in your offer, you choose to purchase the home as is. But an inspection is still recommended for your own information.</p> <h3><span>Title Search</span></h3> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-does-a-title-company-do"><span>Title companies</span></a> perform a title search to determine who owns the property for sale and has the right to sell it. They’ll also look for an easement or right of way that may prevent you from completing projects, like installing a pool.&nbsp;</p> <p>The end goal is to ensure the seller has the right to sell the home, and protect the buyer’s future ownership.&nbsp;</p> <p>This seems straightforward, but divorces and inherited ownership can complicate things. If someone other than the seller has some ownership in the property, they can interfere with the sale.</p> <p>You’ll also receive a title report to ensure the property can be legally transferred to you.&nbsp;</p> <a id="closing" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">8. Close On Your New Home&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">3 days</span></strong></p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buying-timeline-4.png" alt="Home-buying timeline highlights the “welcome to homeownership” after closing." width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>When the closing reports are complete, you’ll receive a closing disclosure to review and finalize your loan. This specifies the loan’s terms and costs with exact figures.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s a good idea to perform a <a href="https://youtu.be/kEHvWMsWEog"><span>final walk-through</span></a> and inspect the home to ensure everything is in <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>good shape for move-in</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, you’ll come to closing day. You and the seller will sign the final paperwork, transfer necessary funds, and you’ll get your keys.</p> <p>Congratulations! You’re a homeowner, and it’s time to celebrate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Homeownership is a journey that can start well before you ever consider <a href="https://homebuyer.com/nurla#/"><span>pre-approval</span></a>.

These no down payment options exist to help first-time home buyers start building equity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what about <a href="https://youtu.be/mgCr0UMY1_g"><span>closing costs</span></a>?&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s also down payment assistance available to help you get a mortgage with no money out of pocket. Federal, state, and non-profit agencies — and even mortgage lenders — offer grants and loans to support first-time buyers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s take a look.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/qualifications-by-loan-type%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Chart shows minimum recommendations for down payment and credit score by loan type. "></p> <a id="down-payment-assistance" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h3>1. Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance</h3> <p>Down payment assistance (DPA) can help you buy a home without immediate cash. This includes several federal, state, and non-profit programs for first-time home buyers.</p> <p>At Homebuyer, we partner with the Chenoa Fund to make homeownership possible without paying anything out of pocket.</p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-buyer-down-payment-assistance.png" alt="Image shows three types of zero-down payment assistance and their benefits and qualifications. " loading="lazy" style="width: 1521px;" width="1521"></span></strong></p> <p>Through our partnerships, Homebuyer.com provides DPA for buyers purchasing a home with an FHA loan, offering an affordable and user-friendly path to homeownership.</p> <p>Buyers have two choices — a 3.5 percent second loan to cover your down payment, or a 5 percent second loan to cover down payment and closing costs</p> <p>If you’re a middle-income earner, or lower, the second loan has zero interest and no monthly payments. Plus, it’s a forgivable second mortgage. If you make your housing payments on time, the loan is forgiven and you never have to pay it back.</p> <p>The 3.5 percent option is forgiven after you make your first 36 mortgage payments on time.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 5 percent option is forgiven after you make 10 years of payments without falling 60 or more days behind. If you do fall behind, there is still no interest and no payments — you’ll just have to pay back the second lien when you sell or refinance the house.</p> <p>If you’re a higher-income earner, the second loan has a monthly payment. Buyers can choose a 10-year loan with no interest, or a 30-year loan with 5 percent interest.</p> <p>Down payment assistance programs typically have credit history and income requirements. Programs for first-time home buyers may require completion of a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/start"><span>mortgage education course</span></a>.</p> <p>These down payment assistance options are available now and you can apply by getting pre-approved.</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p> <a id="USDA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h3>2. USDA Loans With No Money Down</h3> <p><a href="/learn/what-is-a-usda-loan" rel="noopener">USDA loans</a> have no down payment requirements or credit score minimums. Designed to encourage increased homeownership in rural areas, these loans provide subsidized interest rates.</p> <p>Applicants must prove creditworthiness. Lenders typically require a credit score of 620 or higher to apply.</p> <p><span>USDA loan applicants</span> must:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Be a legal permanent U.S. resident</li> <li aria-level="1">Prove creditworthiness</li> <li aria-level="1">Maintain dependable income</li> <li aria-level="1">Have a household income matching 115 percent of the area’s median income or lower</li> <li aria-level="1">Be the primary residence&nbsp;<a href="https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do?pageAction=sfp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>in a rural area</span></a></li> </ul> <p>USDA mortgages can be used to purchase these property types:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Existing home</li> <li aria-level="1">New construction</li> <li aria-level="1">Manufactured homes</li> <li aria-level="1">Condos</li> <li aria-level="1">Townhouses</li> <li aria-level="1">Short sale or foreclosed homes</li> </ul> <p>Buyers are typically responsible for closing costs, lender fees, and mortgage insurance, though there are opportunities to have some of these expenses covered by the seller or your lender.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can receive seller concessions and lender credits, where the seller and lender will pay some, or all, of your closing costs.</p> <a id="VA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h3>3. VA Home Loans With No Down Payment</h3> <p>VA loans provide home-buying options for U.S. military members, veterans, and their spouses. Like USDA loans, VA loans have no down payment or credit score requirements, though most lenders prefer a credit score of 580 or higher.</p> <p>You must have a <a href="https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>certificate of eligibility</span></a> (COE) to apply for a VA loan. This certifies your service history and current duty status to prove you’re eligible.&nbsp;</p> <p>VA eligibility requires:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">You served 90 days of active wartime service</li> <li aria-level="1">You served 180 days of active peacetime service</li> <li aria-level="1">You served six years in the National Guard or Reserves</li> <li aria-level="1">You’re the spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or following a service-related disability</li> </ul> <p>The VA guarantees loans against losses with an entitlement, which is similar to <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi"><span>private mortgage insurance</span></a>. This allows lenders to offer a zero-down payment purchase with less risk and lower rates.</p> <p>VA loan borrowers are <a href="https://www.military.com/money/va-loans/va-loan-closing-costs-who-pays.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>exempt from certain closing costs</span></a>, like underwriting and attorney fees.&nbsp;</p> <a id="Conventional-97" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Conventional Loan 97 for First-Time Home Buyers</h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/community/mortgagelending/guide/part-1-docs/fannie-standard-97-percent-loan-to-value-mortgage.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Conventional Loan 97</span></a> allows borrowers to secure a conventional loan mortgage with a 3 percent down payment. Personal contribution isn’t required. <a href="/learn/mortgage-gift-letter" rel="noopener">Mortgage gifts</a>, grants, and other DPA can cover your down payment.</p> <p>The Conventional Loan 97 is an alternative to FHA loans. It has fewer up-front costs and no permanent mortgage insurance requirements.&nbsp;</p> <p>Borrowers must meet the following criteria to be eligible:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">At least one borrower must be a first-time home buyer</li> <li aria-level="1">Mortgages must have a fixed-rate interest</li> </ul> <p>The Conventional Loan 97 can’t be used to purchase manufactured homes.

VA loans are only available to service members and veterans who meet duty requirements, as well as their spouses.&nbsp;</p> <p>USDA loans can only be used to purchase rural properties.

Each program has specific eligibility requirements.</p> <p>Some loans are flexible and accept down payments entirely funded through gifts, grants, and loans. You may not have to contribute your own savings. This includes DPA funds and assistance from family or friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>Otherwise, the best way to save is with a comfortable budget and savings plan. Determine which loans you’re eligible for and their down payment requirements to set a goal. Consider how much you can save each month to determine your home-buying timeline.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Is private mortgage insurance (PMI) bad?</h3> <p>Mortgage insurance isn’t good or bad. Lenders may require PMI to protect their investment in case a borrower can’t continue to make payments. And this protection is what allows lenders to offer so many low down payment mortgage options.</p> <p>Some loan types require PMI, and it’s also required for borrowers who make a down payment less than 20 percent of the home’s sale price. Some policies exist for the life of your loan, while others can be canceled once homeowners reach 20 percent equity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Homeowners pay PMI up-front, with an additional monthly payment, or a combination of the two.</p> <p><strong>Consider this:</strong> Home prices are generally increasing. The additional monthly PMI payment may be more cost-effective than waiting until you have a larger down payment.</p> <p>Consider what loan types you’re eligible for and their mortgage insurance requirements. Anticipate additional expenses and budget accordingly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Low and no down payment mortgages make homeownership accessible for first-time buyers. Know which loans you’re eligible for when you’re thinking about how to buy a house with no money. Then, <span>get pre-approved</span> for the mortgage of your choice once you’re ready to start house hunting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy homebuying.&nbsp;</p> <p>{{cta('0d860a55-feb6-4352-9199-544349a15c5b')}}</p> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [ { "@type": "Question", "name": "What credit score do I need to buy a house?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "You can buy a house with a credit score as low as 580, and sometimes lower depending on your lender.

Insurance policies, government fees, and real estate taxes add to your bottom line, and your choice of down payment affects your out-of-pocket numbers.</p> <p>Some home buyers opt for a <a href="/learn/low-down-payment-mortgage" rel="noopener">low down payment loan</a>, which requires less than 20 percent down. Others choose <a href="https://youtu.be/gn5w3GORQ1k"><span>no down payment</span></a> mortgages, which need nothing down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down payment assistance programs are a third popular option. Down payment assistance programs cover most, or all, of the required mortgage down payment.</p> <p>The majority of Homebuyer.com customers request to bring as little cash to their closing as possible. Depending on their state of purchase and loan type, that figure can range from 5 percent all the way down to zero.</p> <a id="down-payment" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Down Payment</span></h2> <p>When you buy a home, your down payment is the amount of your own money you contribute toward the purchase price. The remaining amount becomes your loan size.</p> <p>Statistically, first-time home buyers make smaller down payments than the general home-buying population.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among all home buyers, the average down payment is 12 percent. Active duty servicemen and servicewomen average 4 percent. First-time home buyers average 7 percent. There is no rule for how much money you should put down.</p> <p>Some home buyers use down payment assistance (DPA) programs as part of their purchase.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down payment assistance programs offer low- or no-interest loans of up to $100,000, or forgivable loans and grants to eligible first-time buyers. Many buyers combine the mortgage loan with a DPA to make a 100 percent mortgage</p> <p>The best down payment is the one that makes you comfortable, and leaves you with cash in your bank account to access in an emergency.&nbsp;</p> <a id="prepaid-costs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Prepaid Costs</span></h2> <p>Prepaid costs are upfront payments to third-parties made at closing. Prepaid costs are not closing costs, which are fees for specific services. Rather, prepaid costs are advance payments for ongoing expenses associated with your mortgage or owning a home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prepaid costs include homeowners insurance payments, mortgage insurance payments, and real estate tax payments.</p> <p>Prepaid costs also include a mortgage per diem charge, or daily mortgage interest.</p> <p>Mortgage per diem is based on your closing date. In most cases, it covers mortgage interest that accrues from your date of closing through the last day of the month. A per diem charge is the only time a homeowner pays interest in advance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every other time, it’s paid in arrears.</p> <a id="closing-costs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Closing Costs</span></h2> <p>Closing costs are <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee"><span>third-party fees</span></a> paid when you purchase a home. Closing costs may be due to the <a href="/learn/what-does-a-title-company-do" rel="noopener">title company</a>, the municipality, your lender, and others.</p> <p>Closing costs can vary by loan size, loan type, location, or by mortgage lender and can range from less than one percent to higher than six percent.</p> <p>Here at Homebuyer, closing costs typically fall in the one to two percent range. When you're planning your first-time home buyer budget, two percent would be a good estimate to use.</p> <br> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYL7CAK3G0E" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYL7CAK3G0E" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When you're pre-approved to buy, your lender will provide you with an itemized, binding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYL7CAK3G0E"><span>loan estimate</span></a> to help you budget for buying.</p> <a id="earnest-money" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Earnest Money</span></h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/what-is-an-escrow-account.png" alt="Illustration of a lock, defines an escrow account as an account holding funds and managed by an independent party until an agreement is met.&nbsp;" width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>Earnest money is a cash payment home buyers make after the seller agrees to their offer. Earnest money deposits signal that the buyer is serious about the purchase and intends to follow through.&nbsp;</p> <p>Earnest money payments aren’t made to the seller directly. Earnest money is paid into escrow, where it’s held until closing. At closing, the escrow service releases the money to be applied toward down payment, closing costs, or back to the buyer so they can reclaim their cash.</p> <p>In some scenarios, your earnest money may be forfeited to the seller.</p> <p>If, as the buyer, you don’t fulfill your obligations to get a mortgage approved; or, if you change your mind about the purchase, the seller may elect to keep your earnest money. This is why earnest money is sometimes known as a Good Faith Deposit.&nbsp;</p> <p>A typical earnest money deposit will range between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars, depending on the sale price of the home. Homes at higher price points typically require larger earnest money checks.</p> <a id="moving-expenses" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Moving Expenses</span></h2> <p>It costs money to move homes and your moving expenses won’t show up on a settlement statement. Have a plan and set a budget. Waiting until the last minute adds stress and costs, and is one of our top 16 <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/first-time-home-buyer-mistakes"><span>home-buying mistakes</span></a>.</p> <p>If you plan to <a href="/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-out-of-state" rel="noopener">buy a house out of state</a> that is a long distance away, you may want to consider hiring professional movers. In that case, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the least busy and offer the best deals. Moving near the beginning of the month is another way to save money.</p> <p>If you plan to move by yourself, account for the costs of packing boxes, heavy-duty tape, Sharpie markers, and equipment rental.&nbsp;</p> <a id="prepaid-expenses" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Prepaid Expenses</span></h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/prepaid-costs-vs-closing-costs.png" alt="Image compares prepaid costs, closing costs, and ongoing costs of homeownership." width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></p> <p>Prepaid expenses are independent of home closing costs. Prepaid expenses are the costs of homeownership, and they likely begin before you move in. These include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Real estate taxes</li> <li aria-level="1">Homeowners insurance premiums</li> <li aria-level="1">Mortgage interest (between closing date and first mortgage payment)</li> </ul> <p>These prepaid expenses will also help you set up an ongoing escrow account which includes your taxes and homeowners insurance premiums in your monthly housing payment. This way they will always be paid current and you won't be surprised by a lump sum payment once or twice per year.</p> <a id="maintentance-costs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>Maintenance Costs</span></h2> <p>Part of owning a home is caring for it and preparing for <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/home-maintenance-checklist"><span>regular home maintenance</span></a>. It’s a good idea to budget 1.5 percent of the home’s value for annual maintenance costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>A home inspection gives you initial insights into needed home and appliance repairs. Learn how often features like your roof, siding, and toilets need replacing and budget for these costs.</p> <a id="home-savings-goals" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2><span>How To Meet Your Home Savings Goals</span></h2> <p>Saving money is always easier when you have a detailed budget and clear goal. Look over previous bank statements and see how much you spend on necessities like rent, groceries, and car maintenance. Then see where you’re spending on wants like restaurants, accessories, and hobbies.</p> <p>Once you’ve segmented your spending, see where you can cut costs. For example, you may choose to buy a gym membership instead of paying for weekly fitness classes. You don’t have to give up the things you love to save money.&nbsp;</p> <p>Calculate how much you can save each month and estimate how many months you'll need to save the money to buy a house. Now you’ll have a better idea of your savings timeline. You can revisit your budget to trim more expenses and save quicker as necessary.</p> <p>It’s helpful to set rewards or savings strategies to help reach your goals. This could be enjoying your favorite breakfast spot every two weeks you don’t eat out. You can also choose a social motivator, like inviting your friends for a movie night, to enjoy their company without overspending.</p> <p>Buying your first home doesn’t have to cost a fortune upfront. Programs are available to help you offset some initial home-buying costs. Low and no down payment loans for those with low credit scores help make homeownership achievable.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the right <a href="https://homebuyer.com/start"><span>home buyer education</span></a> and a little work, you’ll know how much money you need to buy a house and plan accordingly.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/gamify-your-goals-infographic.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-infographic-button.png" alt="Download the Gamify Your Goals Infographic" width="1520" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></post_content>

Mortgages are popular because few home buyers have hundreds of thousands of dollars in their bank account.&nbsp;</p> <p>The majority of mortgages pay off over 30 years.</p> <p>Before we go deep into your mortgage education, let's review a few <a href="/learn/home-buying-terminology" rel="noopener">key mortgage terms</a>:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Lender: </strong>the company that funds your mortgage loan</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Borrower: </strong>the person receiving the mortgage loan — you!</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Down payment: </strong>the amount of cash you bring to the transaction. Down payments may be described in dollar terms (e.g., $10,000) or as a percentage of the home's sale price (e.g., 3 percent)</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan amount: </strong>the amount of money still owed on your mortgage loan. Loan amounts are sometimes called <em>principal</em>.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan term: </strong>the amount of time you have to pay back your loan.

You borrow some amount, you get an interest rate at which to pay it back, and there's a schedule to make your monthly payments.</p> <p>Mortgage payments are due on the first of each month. Lenders grant a 15-day grace period, then late fees are assessed. Many homeowners use their lender's autopay features to prevent late payments.&nbsp;</p> <p>You don't need a bank account or pre-existing relationship to get a mortgage loan. You can get a mortgage loan at any of the following places:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Local retail bank branches, such as Chase or Wells Fargo</li> <li aria-level="1">Neighborhood mortgage companies, such as Cross Country Mortgage or Caliber Home Loans</li> <li aria-level="1">Online mortgage lenders such as Rocket Mortgage or Homebuyer.com</li> </ul> <p>It's wise to apply early — even before you find a home to buy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies show that home buyers who <a href="https://homebuyer.com/start" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>learn about mortgages</span></a> get lower rates than those who do not.

Today, there are five basic mortgage types, each with different rules to qualify.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Conventional mortgages</li> <li aria-level="1">FHA mortgages</li> <li aria-level="1">USDA mortgages</li> <li aria-level="1">VA mortgages</li> <li aria-level="1">Portfolio mortgages</li> </ul> <p>Let's look at all five options.</p> <p><strong>Conventional loans</strong> are usually best for home buyers with salaried or hourly income, some amount of money saved up, and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>good credit</span></a>. Conventional loans require a minimum three percent down payment. For smaller down payments, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>private mortgage insurance (PMI)</span></a> may be required. Eighty-two percent of first-time home buyers use conventional mortgage loans, so you probably will, too.</p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Tip: </strong>Conventional loans are the most common mortgage type. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac usually backs them.</p> <p><strong>FHA loans </strong>are a fallback option for first-time buyers who fall short of the conventional loan requirements. FHA mortgages allow down payments as low as 3.5 percent and credit scores down to 500. Approximately 10 percent of first-time home buyers use FHA mortgage loans. They're popular with home buyers who purchase multi-unit homes for house hacking.&nbsp;</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip: </strong>FHA loans are ideal for low- to moderate-income buyers, backed by the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/fhahistory" style="color: #4a6ee0;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Federal Housing Administration (FHA)</span></a>.</p> <p><strong>VA loans</strong> are loans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Created as part of the G.I. Bill in 1944, VA loans are available to current and past members of the U.S. military. VA loans don't require a down payment nor mortgage insurance. <a href="https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/funding-fee-and-closing-costs/" style="color: #4a6ee0;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Certain veterans are exempt</span></a> from standard VA closing costs.</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip: </strong>Active duty military service members and veterans, surviving spouses, and Reserves and National Guard members may receive VA loans backed by the <a href="https://www.va.gov/" style="color: #4a6ee0;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span></a>.</p> <p><strong>USDA loans</strong> are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and designed to promote homeownership in rural and low-density areas. <a href="/learn/what-is-a-usda-loan" rel="noopener"><span>USDA loans</span></a> are 100 percent mortgages with subsidized interest rates. Home buyers must be of modest means to use the program and purchase a modest home for the area.</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip: </strong>USDA loans are backed by the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/" style="color: #4a6ee0;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</span></a><span> </span>and are for home buyers of modest means purchasing modest homes.</p> <p><strong>Portfolio loans</strong> are loans that mortgage lenders make and hold on their balance sheets (i.e., in their portfolios). Government groups don't back portfolio loans, so there are no standard means of approval. Each lender makes its own rules. Jumbo mortgages are a type of portfolio loan. In general, getting a portfolio loan requires better-than-average income and credit.&nbsp;</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip: </strong>Jumbo loans are the most common non-conforming loan, ideal for when home costs exceed conforming home loan limits. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can't buy jumbo loans.</p> <a id="howDo" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Do Mortgage Rates Work?</h2> <p>Twelve factors make up your mortgage rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some factors are within your control, such as <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/cheapest-state-to-buy-a-house" style="color: #4a6ee0;"><span>the state you buy your home in</span></a><span> </span>and your FICO credit score. Other factors are outside your control, such as inflation rates.</p> <p>The starting point for all mortgage rates is a Wall Street instrument called mortgage-backed securities (MBS).&nbsp;</p> <p>Mortgage-backed securities are bonds that trade Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM ET. As bond prices change, so do mortgage rates, and bond prices are unpredictable.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, mortgage bonds are denominated in U.S. dollars, so there are two basic rules:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1">When the U.S. dollar is strong, mortgage rates should fall</li> <li aria-level="1">When the U.S. dollar is weak, mortgage rates should rise</li> </ol> <p>During periods of low inflation and political stability, the U.S. dollar tends to be strong. That's good for U.S. mortgage rates. Economic instability, on the other hand, is terrible.</p> <p>You can't affect geopolitics or the world economy, though, so focus on your personal traits.</p> <p>Mortgage lenders reserve the best mortgage rates for home buyers with high-tier credit scores — 740 and higher. Then, for every 20 points your credit score drops, mortgage rates increase.</p> <p>Your mortgage rate is also affected by:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The state you buy your home in</li> <li aria-level="1">The size of your mortgage loan</li> <li aria-level="1">The number of years in your loan term</li> </ul> <p>As a home buyer, present yourself as a low-risk buyer, and you'll get the lowest rate.

Mortgage rates can change anytime the mortgage-backed bond market is open.</p> <p>Mortgage rates change at least once daily — at the market open. Rates change again when markets are volatile.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several times in the last few years, mortgage rates changed five times in one day, which is challenging to navigate.</p> <p>When mortgage rates change, open offers for mortgage rates expire. A lender won't give you yesterday's rates the same way a stockbroker won't provide you with yesterday's stock price.</p> <p>So, when you get a mortgage rate offer you're comfortable with, lock it.</p> <p class="callout"><strong>Tip:</strong> Interest rates change every weekday, Monday through Friday.&nbsp;</p> <h3>What Is The Difference Between A Fixed-Rate Mortgage and an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage?</h3> <p>Over the life of the loan, the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage doesn't change — the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) can.</p> <p>For many home buyers, adjustable-rate mortgages are inappropriate. Hence, fewer than five percent of buyers used ARMs over the last ten years. When in doubt, choose fixed.</p> <p>There are scenarios when ARMs make sense, though. Here's how most ARMs work.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Your mortgage is assigned a teaser interest rate over the first set of years, usually five.</li> <li aria-level="1">After the teaser period ends, your interest rate adjusts annually based on a predetermined formula.</li> <li aria-level="1">After 30 years, the principal is paid in full, and no more payments are due.</li> </ul> <p>At today's mortgage rates, adjustable-rate mortgage rates can be 0.75 percentage points below comparable fixed-rate mortgage rates, saving home buyers $500 per year for every $100,000 borrowed.</p> <p>Annual savings change after the teaser period ends.</p> <p>Since 2003, ARMs have adjusted downward. However, when ARMs adjust higher, it's not all terrible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rules govern ARM interest rates. They can only move a few percentage points per year and can never move more than six points in their lifetime. If that sounds scary to you, remember that the same forces that make ARM rates go up are the ones that push your savings account rates higher, too.</p> <div data-hs-responsive-table="true" style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 27px;"> <table style="width: 100%; margin: 27px auto; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 292px;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 58px;"> <td style="width: 48.374%; padding: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: #5462d1; height: 58px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Fixed-Rate Mortgage</span></strong></td> <td style="width: 51.626%; padding: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: #5462d1; height: 58px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Adjustable-Rate</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Mortgage</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 66px;"> <td style="width: 48.374%; padding: 0px; height: 66px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">Interest rate never changes</td> <td style="width: 51.626%; padding: 0px; height: 66px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">Interest rate changes expires</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 77px;"> <td style="width: 48.374%; padding: 0px; height: 77px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">Mortgage payments are predictable</td> <td style="width: 51.626%; padding: 0px; height: 77px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">Mortgage payments are unpredictable</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 87px;"> <td style="width: 48.374%; padding: 0px; height: 87px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">May have lower mortgage fees</td> <td style="width: 51.626%; padding: 0px; height: 87px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;">May have a lower beginning mortgage rate</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <a id="whatIsA" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Is a Mortgage Pre-approval?</h2> <p>A mortgage pre-approval is a dress rehearsal for your actual mortgage approval.

Your verifications may also require an extra level of detail.&nbsp;</p> <p>The specific items you'll need for your approval will vary based on your mortgage type and how you're employed.</p> <p>For example, conventional mortgages may ask for two recent pay stubs to show evidence of income. Portfolio mortgages may ask for copies of your federal tax returns.</p> <p>If you're salaried, your lender may call your employer to verify your employment.

Mortgage loan limits are lower in areas where home prices are more affordable. They're higher in areas with higher home prices.</p> <p>They also vary by home type.</p> <p>A one-unit home such as a detached single-family residence or condominium will have a lower mortgage loan limit than a 2-unit home in the same state and county.</p> <p>Nationwide, there are 3,233 designated counties. In 95 percent of them, the 2021 conventional mortgage loan limits are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">1-unit home: $548,250</li> <li aria-level="1">2-unit home: $702,000</li> <li aria-level="1">3-unit home: $848.500</li> <li aria-level="1">4-unit home:: $1,054,500</li> </ul> <p>The remaining five percent of counties are High-Cost Areas. Loan limits can range as much as 25 percent higher in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">1-unit home: $822,375</li> <li aria-level="1">2-unit home: $1,053,000</li> <li aria-level="1">3-unit home: $1,272,750</li> <li aria-level="1">4-unit home:: $1,581,750</li> </ul> <p>Mortgage loan limits are reviewed and updated annually, usually during the last week of November.

The best way to boost your credit is to pay your bills on time and keep your credit usage down.</p> <p>Your credit behavior changes will reflect in your score after 30 days, then again after six months. You can increase your score by 100 points or more with diligent effort. Raising your score one hundred points can lower your mortgage rate by one percentage point or more.</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: 0px auto 25px;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5M4FQOpLwUI" width="747" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5M4FQOpLwUI" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <a id="faq" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Mortgage FAQs</h2> <p>Now that you've learned the mortgage basics, here are answers to other common questions:</p> <h3>What salary do you need to qualify for a mortgage?</h3> <p>Mortgage loans are approved considering affordability and don't have specific salary requirements.&nbsp;</p> <p>In general, you may qualify for a mortgage so long as you're not obligating more than 40-45 percent of your household's monthly gross income to debt. There are exceptions to this guideline.</p> <h3>What are good mortgage terms?</h3> <p>The 30-year mortgage term is the most popular choice for affordable monthly payments. A 15-year term is also suitable for long-term financial savings and a lower interest rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consult with a mortgage lender to determine which loan term best fits your situation and financial goals.&nbsp;</p> <h3>What is the difference between pre-qualified and pre-approved?</h3> <p>Mortgage pre-qualification isn't as desirable as pre-approval. Pre-approvals include a credit check and prove your buying power to sellers. Pre-qualifications can provide insight into your financial situation but won't help you buy a house.&nbsp;</p> <p>Neither status is a guarantee of loan approval.</p> <h3>What is mortgage insurance?</h3> <p>Mortgage insurance protects your lender if you're unable to meet contractual obligations.

Read up on these frequently asked questions and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/#hs-open-chat"><span>chat with us</span></a> if you have additional questions.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/credit-score-requirements-loan-type-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Image shows minimum credit score requirements by mortgage loan types."></p> <h3>What credit score do I need to buy a house?</h3> <p>Conventional mortgage loans are the most common and typically require a 620 minimum credit score. Of course, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score minimums</span></a> vary among lenders and mortgage loan types.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many lenders offer FHA and VA loans to buyers with a 580 or higher credit score. FHA loans don’t technically have a credit score requirement, but most lenders want a score of 580 or better to approve your loan.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How much should I save to get a mortgage?</h3> <p>The simple answer is to save as much as you can comfortably afford and contribute to your down payment savings. The exact amount for your mortgage varies depending on your mortgage loan and lender requirements for approval.&nbsp;</p> <p>USDA and VA loans have no down payment requirements, but your lender may have requirements for your approval. You may also want to save a larger down payment to lower your interest rates. Otherwise, you can secure a loan for 3-5 percent down and seek out <a href="https://youtu.be/fHnkr9GGDkk"><span>down payment assistance</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>You should also consider closing costs, moving costs, and other purchases that may come up once you buy your home. It’s a good idea to have extra savings in case of an emergency or <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/home-maintenance-checklist"><span>home repair and maintenance</span></a>, too.&nbsp;</p> <h3>What type of mortgage should I choose?</h3> <p>Your mortgage choice depends on your location, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span>home type</span></a>, and financial health and history. Here are common loan types and their requirements:</p> <p><strong>Conventional loans require:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score of 620</li> <li aria-level="1">A mortgage application</li> <li aria-level="1">3 to 5 percent down payment</li> </ul> <p><strong>FHA loans require:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score of 580</li> <li aria-level="1">3.5 percent down payment</li> <li aria-level="1">Loan lengths must be 15 years or longer</li> </ul> <p><strong>VA loans require:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score of 580</li> <li aria-level="1">Available to active service members and veterans.</li> <li aria-level="1">No down payment requirements</li> </ul> <p><strong>USDA loans require:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score of 620</li> <li aria-level="1">Available for homes located in rural areas.</li> <li aria-level="1">No down payment requirements</li> </ul> <p><strong>Jumbo loans require:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Credit score of 680</li> <li aria-level="1">May require a down payment between 5 percent and 25 percent depending on credit and income</li> <li aria-level="1">More challenging to be approved for due to higher loan amounts.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Different mortgages and lenders have separate requirements for approval, like <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi"><span>mortgage insurance</span></a>. Consult with your lender to determine the best mortgage loan for you.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How many mortgages are there in the U.S.?</h3> <p>There are five types of mortgage loans available to Americans, with conventional mortgages being the most common. While there isn’t an exact number of mortgages in the U.S., <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/homeownership.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>64 percent</span></a> of Americans are homeowners with a combined total of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-mortgage-debt/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>$10.04 trillion</span></a> in mortgage debt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buying a home is an exciting venture that can benefit your financial and emotional well-being. It also requires some extra education on the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>home-buying process</span></a> and the current real estate industry.

Host a Housewarming Party</h2> <p>Greet your neighbors and invite them over for a housewarming party to settle into your new house. You can keep it simple with a house tour and refreshments, or plan a bash with party games and a theme.&nbsp;</p> <p>Housewarming parties are a great way to meet your neighbors and allow them to develop relationships with each other, too. Invite as many people from the neighborhood as you feel comfortable hosting and enjoy.&nbsp;</p> <a id="sweet-treat" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>2. Share a Sweet Treat&nbsp;</h2> <br> <p>Bake a treat to say hello and make a great first impression. Your favorite cookie recipe will do, though keep in mind your neighbors may have food allergies. You can bake a variety of goodies or have a backup gift, like a potted succulent, just in case.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you’re ready to deliver your treats, print out these door hangers to introduce yourself and share your contact information in case anyone needs a favor.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/happy-fall-yall-door-hanger.jpg" alt="First-time home buyer hangs a printable paper door hanger on the door that says “happy fall, y’all.” Probably because she lives in Texas.

Enjoy a Dinner Party</h2> <p>Dinner parties allow everyone to get to know each other in a casual setting. Customize your dinner plans to your preference or lifestyle. If you don’t want to cook all weekend, consider a potluck or cookout and invite your neighbors to contribute their favorite recipes. Just be sure all dishes are labeled with allergens so everyone can enjoy them safely.&nbsp;</p> <a id="favor" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>4. Ask For a Favor and Do a Good Deed</h2> <p>Acts of kindness go a long way in building relationships and a happy community. Offer your leaf blower next time you see your neighbor raking or bring their trash cans back up from the street at the end of pickup day.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your neighbors are sure to return the favor if you give them the chance. Ask them to pick up your mail when you’re out of town or keep an eye out for a package delivery while you’re at work. Helping each other out will build your community’s relationships and overall well-being.&nbsp;</p> <a id="book-club" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>5. Join a Book Club</h2> <p>Connect with other readers and get to know your neighbors with a book club. Bonding over shared interests is a quick way to make new friends. Book discussions will also help you engage deeper with your hobby.</p> <p>If your neighborhood doesn’t already have a book club, see who’s interested in joining. You can take turns selecting books and hosting discussions, or agree to meet at your favorite neighborhood cafe.&nbsp;</p> <a id="doggie-playdate" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>6. Have a Doggie Playdate</h2> <p>Dogs are part of the community just as they are part of our families. Host a playdate so the neighborhood dogs can make new furry friends, too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plan a time to meet at your local dog park or throw a private “pawty” in a fenced yard. You can also organize a weekly dog walk or hike together to stay in touch and get your steps in.</p> <p>Introduce yourself and your pet to the neighborhood with this printable greeting card. Share a photo of your pet and their favorite things with your neighbors, and include your contact information to plan a pawesome playdate.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/welcome-to-the-pawty.jpg" alt="We're a sucker for good puns and this one takes the cake.

Enjoy Your Porch</h2> <p>If parties aren’t for you, a simple “hello” from your porch is an easy way to greet your neighbors and keep in touch. When the weather’s nice, enjoy a book outside or just relax in the sunshine. Invite neighbors to chat with a friendly wave and build relationships over time while keeping your community social.&nbsp;</p> <a id="hoa" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>8. Join Your HOA</h2> <p>Your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/hoa-meaning"><span>homeowners association</span></a> (HOA) is run by neighborhood volunteers, so it’s a convenient way to give back and meet your neighbors. Attend HOA meetings and consider joining the board. You can help plan local events, fundraise and manage dues, or provide your opinions to better the community.&nbsp;</p> <a id="volunteer" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>9. Volunteer in the Community</h2> <p>There are plenty of ways to volunteer in your community and engage with your neighbors. Many neighborhoods have cleanup crews, community gardens, sports teams, and other casual meetups you can join. You can also volunteer for city organizations, like the local animal shelter, if your neighborhood opportunities are limited.</p> <a id="block-party" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>10. Host a Block Party</h2> <p>A block party is the ultimate way to celebrate with your neighbors and greet everyone at once. Your HOA may have annual block parties planned, but if not, you can organize the party with neighborhood volunteers. Check out these block party ideas to find one that works for you and your neighborhood.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Plan a pool party</h3> <p>Pool parties are a summer favorite for a reason. Ask your community pool about hosting a private neighborhood party. That way you can have plenty of space, locker rooms, lifeguards, and snacks readily available.</p> <p>You can also host a pool party in your own private pool if you have one. Invite your neighbors to help supply snacks and chairs, and be sure you have plenty of sunscreen for a day of fun in the sun.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Play party games</h3> <p>Party game classics bring out the kid in everyone and are affordable entertainment options for your block party. Limbo, relay races, and tag games require little equipment and everyone knows how to play.&nbsp;</p> <p>Party games are fun to play individually or as a team. Consider planning a party game tournament for teams to compete, with additional game stations for families to enjoy when they’re not competing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Print out this tournament bundle to welcome your neighbors to the games and label when and where competitions will start. You can also hand out competitor badges as name tags so it’s easy to strike up a conversation with someone new.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/tournament-bundle.jpg" alt="First-time home buyers can meet their neighbors by hosting Yard Games for the neighborhood including Cornhole, Giant Jenga, and Limbo but what you know what game would be AWESOME? Get a trampoline and play some Crack the Egg which might just as easily turn into Crack the Leg because, let's face it, life and also adults are fragile." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/yard-game-tournament-bundle.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-block-party-tournament-bundle.png" alt="Click to download game tournament printables." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></a></p> <h3>Get together for movie night</h3> <p>A projector, blank wall, and friends are all you need to enjoy movie night. Choose a few family-friendly movies and poll your neighbors to choose which to feature.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you don’t have a blank wall, hang a white sheet against a wall or from trees to create your screen. You may also be able to borrow movies and a projector from your local library so you don’t have to invest in any equipment yourself.</p> <h3>Show off your greatest talents</h3> <p>Organize a talent show for your neighbors to celebrate their skills. Keep it a casual performance, or arrange for performers to compete by age groups.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll need a location, an emcee, and some audio equipment at least. See what your <span>community HOA</span> has available or is willing to fund, and you can rent everything else from a local music store.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Organize a scavenger hunt</h3> <p>A scavenger hunt is a fun and cost-effective block party idea that’s especially popular with kids. Create a scavenger hunt list with items you’d find in your neighborhood, like a four-leaf clover or pinecone. You can prepare goodie bags as gifts for everyone who participates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Level up the fun by hiding clues for neighbors to solve until they find a hidden treasure. This is more fun for older kids and adults to participate in. Plan to have enough prizes for everyone or let your neighbors know it’s a race to first place.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Invite a fire truck to visit</h3> <p>Schedule a fire truck visit with your local fire department. Kids will love to explore the truck and learn from firefighters, while the adults learn valuable fire safety lessons. The fire department may also bring goodies like plastic fire hats or badge stickers, or you could prepare favors and treats for the kids yourself.</p> <h3>Celebrate the season</h3> <p>Block parties are great ways to celebrate the season or upcoming holidays as a community. Consider what holidays your neighbors would enjoy celebrating and plan ahead for the festivities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Neighborhood egg hunts are great for Easter, while an art bazaar with hot cocoa stands can help everyone get their holiday shopping done early. Whatever you choose to celebrate, prepare themed games and treats for everyone to enjoy.</p> <h3>Get creative with sidewalk chalk</h3> <p>Decorate your whole neighborhood with a sidewalk chalk art show. Invite families to color the sidewalks, streets, and driveways however they like. Encourage neighbors to tour the art show and display information about their own art, like their piece’s title, inspiration, and artist name, to encourage conversation and get to know your neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Ride in a bike parade</h3> <p>Show off your wheels and get creative with a bike parade. Encourage your neighbors to decorate their bikes with streamers, posters, glitter, and whatever else they like! They may even use a wagon to create their own mini float.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enjoy riding together and greeting your other neighbors. Just communicate your parade route with the community and city in advance so everything’s safe and legal.</p> <h3>Organize a 5K</h3> <p>Get active and organize a 5K for your neighborhood. You can keep it simple with an organized race, or prepare as a community with weekly walks or runs around the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p> <p>Virtual races are a popular alternative for runners to participate without the pressure of a full 5K in one day. Have your neighbors track their runs over a few weeks and celebrate everyone’s accomplishments with an after-party.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Host a community yard sale</h3> <p>Find a new home for all of your unwanted items and pick up some new goods for yourself with a community yard sale. Rehoming items can keep your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/energy-efficient-homes"><span>neighborhood sustainable</span></a> and allows you to mingle with your neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Start a bonfire</h3> <p>Bonfires are the perfect casual get-together. Have your neighbors over to chat around the fire, enjoy food and drinks, and maybe even break out a campfire song. You can pull out group party games and start a collaborative playlist to keep everyone entertained. You may also consider finding campfire stories to tell, especially if your bonfire is family-friendly!</p> <h3>Have a grill-off</h3> <p>Invite your neighborhood cookout enthusiasts to a competitive grill-off. You can arrange prizes for the top cooks — of course, the title of “best neighborhood grill chef” is the real prize.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll need judges, participants, and grills to get started. Parks are a great place to cook and eat together. Many have grills built-in, too. Just be sure there are no fire or grill restrictions in the park and invite participants to bring their own grill of choice.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How To Plan a Block Party</h2> <p>Once you decide to have a block party, there are a few key steps that will help you plan the event. Your first step is to get other neighbors excited about the party and willing to help out. Then you can plan the party together.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Step 1: <strong>Get a committee</strong> of volunteers willing to help you plan.</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 2: <strong>Pick your event date,</strong> ideally a few months in advance.</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 3: <strong>Get permits</strong> from your city and HOA, especially if you’re hosting the party in the street or a community area.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 4: <strong>Plan the party’s</strong> theme, entertainment, location, and refreshment details.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 5: <strong>Invite your neighbors</strong> and promote the party regularly to ensure a good turnout.</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 6: <strong>Assign volunteers</strong> to run the party day-of so everyone has a role.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Step 7: <strong>Prepare to clean up</strong> the event, including putting away tables and chairs, taking decorations down, and picking up trash.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Make sure your party meets all local regulations and is properly cleaned up afterward so everyone can get excited about the next event your community throws.&nbsp;</p> <p>A happy and healthy neighborhood starts with conversation and collaboration. If you just <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-out-of-state"><span>moved to a new state</span></a> or you want to love where you live more, brainstorm how to get to know your neighbors better and support your community.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>When buying a home, your escrow provider is a valuable member of your team. However, many home buyers and sellers can’t answer the question “what is escrow?” or explain how it works.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>In a real estate transaction, a trusted third party is hired to hold all documents and funds for both buyer and seller. This third party can be a law firm, <a href="/learn/what-does-a-title-company-do" rel="noopener">title company</a>, or escrow company, and the documents and funds are held “in escrow.” The escrow provider safeguards your funds and protects all parties by ensuring the terms of the purchase contract and mortgage agreement are carried out.</p> <p>Let’s look at the various types of escrow accounts in the real estate process and how they work.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#what-is-escrow" rel="noopener">What is Escrow?</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#how-does-escrow-work" rel="noopener">How Does Escrow Work?</a></li> <li aria-level="2"><a href="#types-of-escrow" rel="noopener">Types Of Escrow</a></li> <li aria-level="2"><a href="#Escrow-FAQs" rel="noopener">Escrow FAQs</a></li> </ul> <a id="what-is-escrow" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Is Escrow in Real Estate?</h2> <p>When you sign a purchase contract, there may be an earnest money deposit involved. This is an up-front amount that comes from your down payment and shows the seller you’re <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/making-an-offer-on-a-house"><span>committed to buying the home</span></a>.</p> <p>To protect both the buyer and the seller, the money is held in an escrow account managed by an independent and trusted third party until it’s time to close on your home.</p> <p>Why do both parties need to be protected?&nbsp;</p> <p>When a seller accepts an offer, they take the property off the market. If the buyer backs out, the seller often keeps the earnest money as compensation.</p> <p>If the seller does not meet the contract terms or are unable to deliver the home in the same condition as when the contract was made, the earnest money would be returned to the buyer, releasing the buyer from the contract.</p> <p>The escrow officer or escrow agent follows through on these agreed upon terms and provides the funds to the appropriate party.</p> <a id="how-does-escrow-work" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Does Escrow Work?</h2> <p>In addition to the earnest money, the escrow account is typically used to hold funds for down payment and closing costs, credits back from the seller, and any other funds that are part of the transaction.</p> <p>After the closing is complete, the escrow holder will distribute all funds as detailed in the real estate contract and mortgage agreement. These payments include real estate agent commissions, <a href="/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee" rel="noopener">loan origination</a>, title, and insurance fees, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/hoa-meaning"><span>HOA dues</span></a>, the purchase funds from your mortgage loan, and any other closing costs as detailed in your final <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/closing-disclosure/?_gl=1*1v210qk*_ga*Mjg3OTQ4MDgzLjE2MzA2OTU0NjU.*_ga_DBYJL30CHS*MTYzMDY5NTQ2NC4xLjEuMTYzMDY5NTU0OC4w" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Closing Disclosure</span></a>.</p> <p>The escrow agent carefully follows the details of the real estate contract and the written instructions of your lender so all funds get where they need to go.</p> <a id="types-of-escrow" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Types of Escrow Accounts</h2> <p>Escrow accounts are common in real estate and are used widely in other business transactions as well.</p> <p>There are two types of escrow accounts typically used in the real estate process.</p> <p>As detailed above, the first type of escrow account is used to manage the transaction when you buy a home.</p> <p>The second type of escrow is called a mortgage escrow account.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Mortgage escrow account</h3> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;" data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZxRnnfJ3hbs" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" xml="lang" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZxRnnfJ3hbs" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>A mortgage escrow account begins at loan closing and lasts for the life of your loan.</p> <p>With a mortgage escrow account, you make monthly payments to the lender for your property taxes and homeowners insurance.</p> <p>This money is added to your monthly mortgage payment and is held by the mortgage company. They pay your property taxes and homeowners insurance when they are due.</p> <p>Escrow accounts are typically required when you finance more than eighty percent of a home’s value, so most first-time buyers will enjoy the ease of budgeting provided by an escrow account automatically.</p> <h3>Non-real estate escrow accounts</h3> <p>Escrow accounts are useful in any situation where two parties want protection until agreed upon terms are met. Here are some non-real estate examples.</p> <p><strong>Renters Escrow</strong></p> <p>If you’ve ever rented an apartment or house, you know that landlords can sometimes fail to make necessary repairs or improvements in a timely fashion. A renter’s escrow account allows you to place your rent with a third party to be given to the landlord when the necessary repairs are made or working appliances are installed. This gives the renter some leverage to ensure their unit is repaired as promised.</p> <p><strong>Escrow and Online Shopping</strong></p> <p>The growth of online shopping over the past two decades has led to increased use of the escrow process for the protection of buyers and sellers. In this situation, the buyer puts the purchase price into an escrow account where it is held until the shipped item is received. Once the item is in hand, the funds can be released to the seller.</p> <p><strong>Escrow and Stocks</strong></p> <p>Stocks can be held in escrow for a variety of reasons. Frequently, stocks are held by a trusted third-party during a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or reorganization. A company may, for a period, hold stocks in escrow that have been awarded to an employee. This is called a vesting period and is used as an incentive to keep the employee on staff.</p> <h2>Escrow Fees and How It Works</h2> <p>The cost of escrow fees will depend on the escrow company you use and the location of the home, but they will typically be one to two percent of the purchase price.</p> <p>Because this service benefits both the buyer and seller, both parties typically pay a portion of this fee at closing.</p> <p>The escrow fee will be listed on your <a href="/learn/loan-estimate" rel="noopener">Loan Estimate</a> at the beginning of the process, and on the Closing Disclosure which you’ll receive before closing.</p> <h2>Benefits of Escrow</h2> <p>Escrow accounts offer several benefits to all parties in the real estate process.</p> <p>First, placing all instructions and funds into the hands of a third party while under contract offers security to the buyer and seller, ensuring all contract requirements will be met and agreed upon money will be paid.</p> <p>Second, real estate escrows provide assurance to the buyer, seller, and lender that — should the deal go south — no one’s investment will be jeopardized. Funds are protected and will be returned to the appropriate party.</p> <p>Third, a mortgage escrow account assures you and your lender that your taxes and insurance are kept up to date.</p> <p>Finally, the mortgage escrow account provides you with a <a href="/learn/positive-home-buying-experience" rel="noopener">stress-free process</a>. Paying a predictable amount each month makes it easier to budget and you don’t have to worry about tracking the due dates for your taxes and insurance policies.</p> <a id="Escrow-FAQs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Escrow FAQs</h2> <p>Escrow is an essential part of a real estate transaction and mortgage process. Here are some commonly asked questions we see on a regular basis:</p> <h3>What is escrow on a house?</h3> <p>Escrow is an account that holds your funds for earnest money, down payment, and closing costs, as well as the purchase funds from your mortgage lender.

Mortgage escrows typically last the length of the mortgage.</p> <h3>Is escrow good or bad?</h3> <p>Escrow is a valuable and essential tool in the purchase process, providing security for both the buyer and seller of the property.</p> <p>Mortgage escrows help the buyer manage their taxes and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi"><span>insurance payments</span></a>. They are free of charge and provide easy budgeting for home buyers.</p> <h2>A Final Word</h2> <p>Your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup?hsLang=en"><span>home purchase</span></a> is one of the biggest investments you will make. Over the past century of buying and selling real estate in the United States, many processes have been put into place to protect <a href="/start" rel="noopener">the home-buying process</a>, as well as your homeownership rights.

Cob can form the walls and foundation of a home. Homeowners usually build their own cob houses, so prepare for manual labor. Cob homes are not common and aren’t readily available to buy in the U.S.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cob construction is sturdy, sustainable, and small with a unique look. Cob can be combined with other construction practices or materials to create a modern home, or used for smaller projects like sheds and garden walls.</p> <p>Cob homes are not typical in most areas and may be difficult to secure a mortgage for, much like tiny homes and shipping container homes.

" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p>Colonial homes are common around the East Coast and are symmetrical, rectangular-shaped houses. Their simple design is more affordable to build than complex or asymmetrical houses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonial homes have evolved over time and modern styles are often used for mansions. It can be hard to find affordable colonial homes ready to buy, so if you plan on building, sticking to a simple layout and small size keeps construction affordable. They’re also easy to find plans for and can be built up rather than out, so you can save on foundation costs.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-single-family-house" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><span>Average cost to build</span></strong></a><strong>: </strong>$300 per square foot&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/218-Colonial-Cir_Jackson_MS_39211_M75081-06794#photo2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><span>Cost to buy</span></strong></a><strong>: </strong>$172,961</p> <a id="ranch-homes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a><a id="ranchHomes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>5.

A home with a simple and concise layout is the cheapest type of house to build.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ranch homes are typically single-story structures with attached garages. They’re easy to find construction plans for and highly customizable, so you can find a home that fits your needs and budget.

You choose from your builder’s selection of layouts and materials to customize the home. Building the home in panels off-site and restricting the build options makes prefabricated or modular homes affordable.&nbsp;</p> <p>The home layout and upgrades are customizable, but these changes are costly. Prefabricated homes aren’t cheap — just cheaper than an on-site build, so keep affordable style in mind. Prefabricated homes are quicker to construct than on-site builds and are generally more sustainable.</p> <p><a href="https://www.mymove.com/home-inspiration/decoration-design-ideas/basic-facts-about-modular-homes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><span>Average cost to build</span></strong></a><strong>: </strong>$90-$120 per square foot&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.prefabreview.com/blog/clayton-homes-review" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><span>Average cost to buy</span></strong></a><strong>: </strong>$100-$200 per square foot</p> <a id="cheapest-materials-to-buy-a-house" data-hs-anchor="true"></a><a id="cheapestMaterials" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Cheapest Materials to Build a House</h2> <p>Your house style and size determine the amount of materials you need to buy, which is the core of a home’s expense. There are plenty of cheap building materials and alternatives to consider to cut costs.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/average-cost-of-affordable-building-materials.png" alt="Comparison chart of affordable building materials - average costs - homebuyer.com" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <h3>1. Prefabricated panel</h3> <br> <p>Prefabricated panels are built off-site and shipped to you, ready for assembly. You or your contractor can order prefabricated wall panels, framing, floor joists, and roof trusses based on your preferred house style and layout, or layouts offered by the prefabrication company.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prefabricated panels can be made of wood, steel, or concrete. You can also opt to add finishes, paint, or features like fireproofing depending on your panel supplier’s services.&nbsp;</p> <h3>2. Concrete sheets</h3> <p>Concrete sheets are a specific type of prefabricated panel. They’re just as easy to install and save time and money from labor costs, on-site framing and pouring, and help to avoid weather delays. Concrete is an affordable option that’s secure, fireproof, insulating, and weatherproof.&nbsp;</p> <h3>3. Shipping containers</h3> <p>Retired shipping containers are an affordable and sustainable option for setting the base structure of your home. A single container is great for tiny home living. You can also assemble multiple containers or build off of a single container for a larger space.&nbsp;</p> <h3>4. Reclaimed wood</h3> <p>Reclaimed wood is more affordable than fresh lumber and keeps wood out of landfills. You may find it for free through online Buy Nothing groups or construction sites — just be sure to ask permission to pick up discarded wood.</p> <p>Using reclaimed wood as paneling or anywhere it's visible gives your home a unique look with a mix of grains and colors. You can also refinish reclaimed wood to match your aesthetic.&nbsp;</p> <h3>5. Bamboo</h3> <p>Bamboo is a durable lumber alternative that grows quicker than trees, so it’s sustainable. It’s versatile and can be used for framing, roofing, flooring, and fencing. Some bamboo species are also considered <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/good-luck-plants"><span>lucky plants</span></a> for your home.&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s a variety of bamboo species, and the time of harvest impacts its durability. Research the bamboo that fits your construction needs and providers before you buy.&nbsp;</p> <h3>6. Brick</h3> <p>Brick is an affordable building material that can be bought new, recycled from old construction, or even made at home. You can find salvaged brick through online marketplaces, Buy Nothing groups, and construction or demolition sites.</p> <p>Brick installation is time-consuming, so you may pay more in labor. If you’re willing and experienced enough to lay your own brick or know a good contractor, this can still be an affordable option for your house.&nbsp;</p> <h3>7. Cob</h3> <p>Cob is a mixture of clay, sand, straw, and water that you can make at home. It can be formed around a simple frame, built up on its own, or made into bricks for construction. It’s a good insulator and a sturdy building material that has been used for centuries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cob may not fit your lifestyle needs and is best for tiny homes. You can use it in addition to other construction methods or to build a shed or <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/curb-appeal-ideas"><span>landscaping structures</span></a>. Check local laws if you plan to build a cob home to ensure it’s permitted in your city and state.&nbsp;</p> <h3>8. Recycled bottles</h3> <p>Recycled bottles can be used as a construction alternative that’s popular for sustainability or aesthetics. <a href="https://www.ecobricks.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Ecobricks</span></a> are plastic bottles stuffed with plastic waste to create durable bricks that reduce pollution. They can technically be used to build a house, but they’re better suited for small structures like gardens, sheds, or even furniture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Glass bottles can also be trimmed to remove the neck and secured in adobe, cob, or concrete. You can place the cut ends of the bottles together and leave the bottom ends uncovered for a stained glass effect.&nbsp;</p> <a id="cheapest-way-to-build-a-house" data-hs-anchor="true"></a><a id="cheapestWay" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Cheapest Way to Build a House</h2> <p>If you have the experience and know-how, then constructing your own home is the cheapest way to build a house. Follow pre-created design plans or work with an architect to ensure your home layout works. Also consider hiring subcontractors for electrical, plumbing, or other areas where you lack experience. It’s cheaper to do it right the first time than to pay to fix mistakes later.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you decide to hire a home builder, spend the extra money to hire an experienced contractor.

Location and personal preferences have an impact, too. <a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/architects-and-engineers/build-a-house/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>HomeAdvisor</span></a> reports the average cost to buy a home is $285,000, while building a home averages $287,466 and can cost up to $150,000 more than buying.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you live in a competitive market, it may make more sense to build a home than compete with other buyers. New construction may also be a better option if you have a lot of specific needs for your home that would require expensive renovations in an existing house.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Can you build a small house for $50K?</h3> <p>Technically yes, you can build a house for $50,000, but it won’t be easy. A simple tiny house or repurposed shipping container makes building a home for under $50,000 achievable. However, you need land to build on to begin construction, which can be much more expensive. You also need to pay for all building permits, <a href="https://homeguide.com/costs/building-permit-cost" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>which can cost up to $3,000</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <h3>What is the most expensive part of building a house?</h3> <p>High lumber costs make framing the most expensive part of home construction. Your actual property is also costly and varies significantly by location. Land may be more expensive than the entire home construction in high-cost areas.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Buying a home is more convenient</h3> <p>Buying a pre-existing home is quicker than building a new house, especially if you consider weather delays, construction complications, or the potential to go over budget. You can also tour an existing home to find the right look and feel.&nbsp;</p> <p>New construction is based on your design, so it’s highly customizable. The finished product and quality vary — your finished house may be everything you dreamed of, or it might need some improvements.&nbsp;</p> <h3>New construction is easier to customize</h3> <p>New construction allows you to collaborate with an architect to design your dream home and customize everything from kitchen cabinets to closet space. You have the option to renovate a pre-existing home, but a house’s structure may limit your creativity. New construction is ideal if you have specific ideas about what you want in your house.&nbsp;</p> <p>Building a new home can be an affordable option in high-competition housing markets. It can seem expensive at first, but alternative homes and building materials help keep you within your budget. It’s often more sustainable and allows you to personalize your home.

" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></a></p> <p>These home maintenance tasks will prepare your home for moving day so you can enjoy a clean and happy home.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Deep clean your home</strong></p> <p>Clean and disinfect all surfaces so your home is ready for move-in day. Scrub walls and baseboards, scrub appliances thoroughly, and rent a carpet cleaner to get all of the dust and dander out.&nbsp;</p> <p>A clean home is easier to maintain and saves you time and energy after moving so you can relax and enjoy your home.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>8 hours</p> <p><strong>Replace your home’s filters</strong></p> <p>Replace your home’s air filters for cleaner, healthier air. Air filters should be changed every 30-60 days afterward.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 5 minutes</p> <p><strong>Find your water and electric controls</strong></p> <p>Each utility has a control panel or shut-off valve in your home. Learn how to control your water and electricity so you can quickly turn them on or off for maintenance or in an emergency.</p> <p>Main water shut-off valves are typically found around the exterior perimeter of your home, often facing the street. Your home inspection should include the location and a photo of the valve. Your home may also have a curb valve located near the street or sidewalk at your property line.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your electric panel will be a large gray box installed on a wall — typically in your garage, laundry room, closet, outside wall, or another low-traffic area. Check to see if your panel is a fuse box or circuit breaker and learn how to control it.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>30+ minutes&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Check your safety devices</strong></p> <p>Ensure your home is secure and all safety devices are working before moving your family and valuables into the house. Change the locks and install any additional security systems you’d like for your home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Test all existing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Replace the alarms or batteries as needed, and stock up on extra batteries.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>5+ minutes</p> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SS_sbVctwx9bXyKh9q_x2TxJe_CPNECTvwO05y-zwEc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-maintenance-spreadsheet.png" alt="Click to download home maintenance checklist spreadsheet.

Repeat the tasks below every month of the year.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Check your HVAC filters</strong></p> <p>HVAC filters should be replaced every 30-60 days, depending on your system and the season. Heavy use in the winter and summer means you should change your filters more often.&nbsp;</p> <p>Clean filters improve your appliance’s efficiency, extend its lifespan, and keep your air cleaner.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>5 minutes</p> <p><strong>Check your water softener and heater</strong></p> <p>Water softeners and heaters are pretty low-maintenance, though it’s good to check on them monthly. <a href="https://www.mrrooter.com/oneida/about-us/blog/2019/april/water-softener-maintenance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Check your water softener</span></a> for salt bridges and mushing, and replenish salt as needed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Water heaters should have their temperatures and pressure relief valves inspected monthly. Just lift the pressure relief valve and if water doesn’t release, replace your valve. Look for cracks and leaks as you inspect the water heater.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>5+ minutes&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Clean your garbage disposal</strong></p> <p>Clean your garbage disposal to eliminate odors and prevent bacteria or mold build-up. Always turn power to your disposal off before performing maintenance to avoid accidents. Follow these steps to clean your disposal:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1">Remove and clean the rubber splash guard</li> <li aria-level="1">Remove remaining food particles</li> <li aria-level="1">Pour in half a cup of baking soda and set for 30 minutes</li> <li aria-level="1">Pour in a cup of vinegar and set five minutes</li> <li aria-level="1">Rinse with hot water</li> <li aria-level="1">Grind two cups of ice and one cup of salt until crushed</li> </ol> <p>The baking soda and vinegar power through slime, while the ice and salt clean the blades.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>45 minutes</p> <p><strong>Test your home’s safety devices</strong></p> <p>Your home’s safety alarms should be tested every month to ensure they function properly and the batteries are in good condition. Replace batteries or alarms as necessary</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>5 minutes</p> <p><strong>Inspect and clean vents and heat registers</strong></p> <p>Remove dirt, dust, and debris from your air vents and heat registers each month. Ensure that vents aren’t blocked by furniture and clutter, and vacuum dirt from hard-to-reach areas. Clean vents keep your appliances efficient and remove circulating dust and dander from the air.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>20+ minutes</p> <a id="fall-home-maintenance" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Fall Seasonal Home Maintenance Checklist</h2> <p>Fall is your chance to prepare for winter weather before snow is in the forecast.

Print out the appliance maintenance checklist to ensure your HVAC systems and other appliances are working properly.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/appliance-maintenance-checklist.jpg" alt="You're going to print this list and probably ignore it, but don't. Buying your first home requires a shift in thinking. There's no landlord to call when life goes sideways - you're unclogging that toilet on your own." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/appliance-maintenance-checklist.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-appliance-maintenance-checklist.png" alt="Click to download appliance maintenance checklist." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></a></p> <p>Seasonal home maintenance both inside and outside is vital for your home’s health as weather changes over time, so be prepared.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Fall exterior maintenance</h3> <p>Clean your yard and close down seasonal features you won’t be using to maintain their condition before temperatures drop.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Rake leaves and yard debris</strong></p> <p>Clear leaves and other yard debris from your grass to prevent lawn damage and mold. Toss leaves in the trash or break them down and apply them to garden beds as mulch to warm shrubs and landscaping.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mow your lawn weekly to keep leaves broken down and save time on raking.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1+ hours</p> <p><strong>Clean and inspect your roof and gutters</strong></p> <p>Falling leaves and other debris can clog your gutters and cause long-term roof and water damage. Clean your roof and gutters to ensure water is flowing properly and exits away from your home’s foundation.&nbsp;</p> <p>While cleaning gutters, inspect your roof and gutters for damage and make any necessary repairs before winter.</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1-3 hours</p> <p><strong>Shut off exterior sprinklers and valves</strong></p> <p>Shut off all exterior water valves and sprinklers before the season’s first freeze to prevent burst pipes and damage. Turn off sprinkler timers and drain the remaining water from the system.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once external water sources are off, add insulating covers to keep the pipes from freezing.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1-2 hours</p> <p><strong>Close down your pool</strong></p> <p>Once summer swim weather passes, it’s time to <a href="https://cincinnatipoolandpatio.com/7-easy-tips-closing-pool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>close your pool</span></a> for the season. Clean your pool thoroughly, test the water, and add winterizing chemicals. Then drain and remove the pump and hoses, and cover the pool.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>2 hours</p> <h3>Fall interior maintenance</h3> <p>Clean and inspect your home so it’s ready for heating.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Inspect your home’s heating</strong></p> <p>Your home’s HVAC system, furnace, or boiler and air ducts should be serviced annually, and calling a professional in the fall means you won’t be caught in the cold if it needs repairs. Clean the exterior of your heating units and any vents to remove any blockages and prevent fires.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1-2 hours</p> <p><strong>Inspect and insulate windows and doors</strong></p> <p>Walk around your home’s exterior and ensure all windows and doors open and close smoothly. Check for air leaks, drafts, or damage and repair as necessary. Add weatherstripping or insulation to prevent heat loss.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1 hour</p> <p><strong>Clean your dryer vent</strong></p> <p>Laundry dryer vents should be inspected and cleaned by a professional each year. Clogged dryer vents are a fire risk, but they can also damage your machine and reduce efficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1 hour</p> <p><strong>Clean and inspect your fireplace</strong></p> <p>Wood-burning fireplaces produce tar and creosote build-up in the chimney, which is a fire hazard. Have a professional inspect and clean chimneys and fireplaces each year. Treated chimney cleaning logs may reduce creosote build-up, but it’s not a substitute for a professional cleaning.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 1 hour</p> <a id="winter-home-maintenance" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Winter Seasonal Maintenance Checklist</h2> <p>Most necessary maintenance will be wrapped up in the fall, but there are still a few seasonal maintenance to-dos to prevent winter damage to your home.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Winter exterior maintenance</h3> <p>Snow and ice can damage your home. Avert damage with these preventative maintenance tasks.</p> <p><strong>Prepare your snow blower, shovel, and salt</strong></p> <p>Make sure you have all the necessary snow supplies before the first winter storm. This may include salt, a snow shovel, an ice scraper, and a snowblower.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>10+ minutes</p> <p><strong>Cover your air conditioner</strong></p> <p>Cover your air conditioning unit to prevent winter damage. You may choose to remove window units, though you can leave them installed with a cover if they’re properly installed without drafts.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 10 minutes</p> <p><strong>Check for icicles and ice dams</strong></p> <p>Regularly inspect your roof for icicles or ice dams that can damage your roof or melt into your home and cause water damage. If your roof tends to collect icicles or ice dams, purchase a roof rake and clear snow before it can melt or freeze into ice.</p> <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 10+ minutes</p> <h3>Winter interior maintenance</h3> <p><strong>Insulate your pipes</strong></p> <p>There are several ways you can protect your pipes from freezing as temperatures drop. Install extra insulation by wrapping Styrofoam around accessible pipes — particularly those in basements and attics that have less insulation overall.&nbsp;</p> <p>Keep your thermostat at 55 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to prevent the home from getting too cold. Open cabinet doors to let heat in where the pipes are and let the faucet drip to protect pipes.</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>10+ minutes</p> <p><strong>Inspect and tighten hardware</strong></p> <p>Inspect hardware in your doors and cabinets and tighten screws to secure loose doorknobs, hinges, and more. Replace broken or damaged hardware as necessary.</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>10+ minutes</p> <p><strong>Clean your drains</strong></p> <p>Grime, hair, and dirt build up in drain pipes and need regular cleaning. Remove any clogs with a plunger, drain auger, or barbed Zip-It. Then pour baking soda and vinegar in your drain, cover for 15 minutes, and flush with hot water to clean and deodorize.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>15-30 minutes</p> <p><strong>Reverse your ceiling fans</strong></p> <p>Ceiling fans can be reversed to push air up or down to cool or warm your home. Fans should spin counterclockwise in the summer and clockwise in the winter. Find the direction switch on the motor body of your ceiling fan.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required:</strong> 5 minutes</p> <a id="spring-home-maintenance" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Spring Seasonal Maintenance Checklist</h2> <p>Spring is the time to tend to any winter damage and deep clean for a fresh start.

The air filter, spark plug, and oil should be changed. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-sharpen-lawn-mower-blades/9ba683603be9fa5395fab904bc45dce" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Mower blades</span></a> should be sharpened every 20-25 hours of use.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Time required: </strong>1-2 hours</p> <p><strong>Repair your driveway and sidewalk</strong></p> <p>Check for cracks in your concrete sidewalk or driveway and repair as necessary.

		<post_date><![CDATA[August 18, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whatDoes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Does HOA Mean?</h2> <p>HOA stands for Homeowners Association.</p> <!--more--><p>An HOA is a non-profit organization made up of volunteers and a governing body that makes and enforces rules for a subdivision of homes, condominium complex, or planned unit development.</p> <a id="howDo" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Do HOAs Work?</h2> <p>When you purchase a property in an HOA, you automatically become a member and will be required to pay dues on a monthly or annual basis.&nbsp;</p> <p>As an HOA member, you’ll be invited to vote for the board of directors who oversee the day-to-day responsibilities of the HOA. This includes the maintenance and care of all shared amenities, collecting fees, and enforcing rules.</p> <p>You will be encouraged to volunteer to assist the board with planned activities throughout the year or take a turn as a board member.</p> <h3>What does the HOA board of directors do?</h3> <p>The board members manage the two most important aspects of the organization: the finances and the rules.</p> <p>Managing the budget is simple if your HOA’s only responsibility is to maintain the sign and landscaping at the entrance to your development. But suppose your board manages multiple common areas, such as recreation facilities, swimming pools, landscaping, and party rooms. In that case, they will require input from the membership to set priorities appropriately and agree upon budgets.</p> <p>Your board will also have the authority to make and enforce community regulations designed to protect property values and the well-being of the community.</p> <p>The HOA’s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) outline all the community rules and regulations. As a potential homeowner in an HOA, this is an essential document that you will want to review before agreeing to buy a home in the community.</p> <p>It’s also a good idea to look at how well the common areas are maintained in addition to touring the home you’re interested in.&nbsp;</p> <a id="whatAre" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Are Homeowners Association Rules?</h2> <p>HOA rules cover a wide range of homeownership rights.</p> <p>When you sign your HOA membership form, you agree to abide by the rules. This agreement is legally binding, so it’s important to know what you’re signing.</p> <p>Typically, the rules will include restrictions on your landscaping choices — such as the type of plants or trees that are acceptable — and on your external décor, including the color of your house, front door, or roof shingles.</p> <p>There are often regulations regarding fencing type and height limits, the addition of outdoor structures, decks, or pools, home maintenance standards, and holiday lighting.</p> <p>Parking can also be a focus of HOA regulations. This can include limiting the number of vehicles that can park on your property, regulations on-street parking, and bans on recreational vehicles, boats, lawn equipment, and bicycles from being left outside a storage unit or garage.</p> <p>And finally, there may be <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/home-buying-guide-pet-parents" style="color: #0563c1;"><span><span style="color: #5462d1;">pet restrictions</span></span></a>, occupancy limits, renting or subletting bans, and <a href="https://www.hoamanagement.com/hoa-noise-rules/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><span style="color: #5462d1;">noise criteria</span>.</span></a></p> <h3>What are HOA fees?</h3> <p>As an HOA member, you are required to pay monthly or annual fees to cover the maintenance of all shared amenities in the community.</p> <p>HOA fees are disclosed as part of the general property information and will also be included on your Closing Disclosure.&nbsp;</p> <p>When approving your mortgage, your lender will include the HOA fee into your monthly mortgage payment to ensure it doesn’t cause you to go over budget.</p> <p>The organization can also charge one-time home transfer fees when you purchase a property, as well as special assessments to cover the cost of unexpected repairs on shared amenities. Your CC&amp;R document will also outline fines that can be imposed for not following any of these rules and regulations.</p> <h3>What do HOA fees cover?</h3> <p>HOA fees can cover a multitude of services. You will appreciate the small price you pay when you enjoy a manicured green space, a sidewalk clear of snow and ice, or a summer gathering with your neighbors.</p> <p>While the fees typically cover only shared spaces and amenities, some HOAs may take care of your landscaping as well as painting and roof repairs. This is more common with townhouse developments where you share a wall or a roof with your neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <a id="whatAreThe" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Are the Benefits of a Homeowners Association?</h2> <p>The mission of an HOA is to invest in the community, provide amenities, and maintain the appearance and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/curb-appeal-ideas"><span>curb appeal</span></a> of the neighborhood. This often includes caring for the external aspects of your home, including your front yard landscaping or cleaning and painting your home’s exterior.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plus, if you’ve ever had to live near challenging neighbors, you will appreciate having a referee that can manage neighbors who fail to keep up their property or make noise late at night.</p> <p>Most significantly, an HOA brings neighbors together through shared interests and organized social events.</p> <h3>Is an HOA right for you?</h3> <p>To decide if an HOA is right for you, consider the following:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">HOA dues will add costs to your monthly obligations</li> <li aria-level="1">The dues will hurt your maximum loan amount</li> <li aria-level="1">Are the benefits of the HOA worth the extra cost and lower loan amount?</li> <li aria-level="1">Do the HOA’s rules fit in with your lifestyle as a pet owner, gardener, or outdoor enthusiast?</li> </ul> <p>Before you decide to purchase the home, thoroughly read the HOA’s CC&amp;Rs. Meet with members of the board of directors to get a better feel for the community and its goals and objectives to ensure they line up with your own.</p> <a id="frequentlyAsked" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>HOA FAQs</h2> <p>Here is a recap of frequently asked questions about HOAs:</p> <h3>What are HOAs supposed to do?</h3> <p>HOAs are designed to maintain a community’s aesthetics and amenities.

Finally, they make and enforce community rules to help keep the community’s appearance and quality of life.</p> <h3>Are HOAs good or bad?</h3> <p>They are great for homeowners seeking community amenities and low-maintenance common areas. However, HOA fees can be expensive, so this does come at a cost.</p> <p>If you are willing to follow the rules and appreciate that your neighbors share similar goals, HOAs can be an effective tool.

Owners pay dues to the association for building maintenance as well as significant projects and updates.</p> <p>A housing cooperative, like a condominium, is a shared building with individual units and common areas.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Open houses are a <a href="/start" rel="noopener">valuable tool for home buyers</a>. You can view a property in a low-pressure environment, and you can usually take as much time as you need. One of the biggest perks is talking to the listing agent and going through your questions to ask at an open house. You can find out about the sellers and their motivations for moving, and get vital information about the property that might not be on the listing.</p> <!--more--> <h2>14 Questions To Ask When Looking at a House</h2> <p>Whether you’re <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-out-of-state"><span>buying a house out of state</span></a> or moving one neighborhood over, asking questions is critical at an open house, so come prepared. Research the home, the neighborhood, and know the listing details. This will help you form specific questions.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Be confident when talking to the seller’s agent, but don’t give too much information about your homebuying goals, finances, and house-hunting experience thus far. Those details are for your real estate agent to know and use in future negotiations.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Here are the questions you’ll want to ask while you’re at an open house:<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <h3>1. Why is the house for sale?</h3> <p>It could be a new job opportunity, moving closer to friends or family, or making a profit. In some cases, the seller could be unhappy with the home.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Knowing the reasons why the homeowner is selling can give you a lot of information. It can point you toward potential pitfalls of the home and provide you with guidance when submitting your offer. If you know there’s a job opportunity looming, the seller could be pressed for time — and submitting a quick offer could help you get the home.</p> <h3>2. How long has the house been on the market?</h3> <p>Knowing how long a home has been on the market is critical when you’re considering an offer. A home that’s been on the market a long time could signify something wrong with the home or that the seller is unwilling to negotiate.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>You can also expect to have more negotiating power if the house has been on the market longer than usual. Sellers are typically more receptive to a lower offer or willing to pay your closing costs if they’re having a hard time selling the home.</p> <h3>3. How many offers has the seller received?</h3> <p>It’s good to find out if the seller has had offers in the past, if they were rejected or fell through, and why that happened. This can give you an idea of how picky a seller is and how open to negotiations they are.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>You also want to know if there are current offers on the table. If you know you’re bidding against other buyers, you’ll be able to put your best offer forward. If you’re not bidding against other buyers, a lower offer might be better received.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <h3>4. Are there any structural issues with the home?</h3> <p>Sellers are required to disclose any structural or code issues they know exist on the property, so be sure to request an official seller’s disclosure from the listing agent. This disclosure will point you toward more specific questions you want to cover.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <h3>5. Has the seller made any DIY renovations?</h3> <p>Ask the agent about any renovations that were done to the home, especially ones done by the homeowner. These are more likely to have issues down the road. Plus, they could create a code violation if they didn’t get the proper permits.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Ideally, any large renovations would have been done by a licensed professional. To be safe, you’ll always want to get a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-home-inspection" style="color: #0000ff;"><span><span style="color: #4c58bc;">professional home inspection</span></span></a> before closing on the home. They’ll let you know about existing issues and what needs to be repaired.</p> <h3>6. When was the home last updated?</h3> <p>You’ll want to get an idea of when the home’s major systems and features were updated — including the roof, siding, electrical system, heating and air conditioning, water heater, and more. This will give you a good grasp of what repairs and replacements you’ll be due for soon.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Your home inspection will help, too. Inspectors include notes about how old significant features are and what lifespan they have left.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h3>7. What’s included with the home sale?</h3> <p>Sellers aren’t required to include anything that’s not attached to the home, so things like refrigerators, stoves, and dishwashers won’t always come with the property.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Ask about what the seller is including in the sale and what they’d be willing to include for the right price. Is it <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home#printables"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #4c58bc; text-decoration: underline;">move-in ready</span></span></a>, or will you need to buy appliances, blinds, curtains, and furniture? This will help you plan your move-in costs.</p> <h3>8. Is there an HOA?</h3> <p>Always ask if the home is attached to an HOA (homeowner’s association). HOAs are common in suburban neighborhoods, and they come with rules, regulations, and fees for residents who live there.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>If the home does have an HOA, ask for its name so you can read up on the organization’s policies. Also, ask what the monthly or annual dues are and any amenities those dues pay for.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h3>9. What’s the neighborhood like?</h3> <p>Loving the home is just one part of the equation. You also want to love the community it’s located in. Ask the agent about the surrounding neighborhood — its amenities, the people who live there, and what businesses and services are in the area.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Also, ask about the neighbors and, if you have children or pets, ask about local playgrounds, trails, and dog parks.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Neighborhood events are another thing to consider. Are neighborhood get-togethers common? Are the streets busy at night? Are there parties on the weekends? Knowing the average age of residents can help you understand what types of activities you may see in the area. These are all excellent questions to keep in mind.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h3>10. What’s the seller’s timeline?</h3> <p>Getting a feel for the seller’s timeline is always wise. Sellers who are ready to move quickly, or have already moved, are typically more open to negotiations. Sellers who are in no rush to sell tend to wait it out for the perfect offer.</p> <h3>11. What utilities does the home have, and what do they cost?</h3> <p>This is an essential question if you want an <span style="color: #4c58bc;"><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/energy-efficient-homes" style="color: #4c58bc;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">energy-efficient home</span></a></span>.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Find out if the home uses natural gas, solar energy, electricity, or a combination. Ask about the heating and cooling systems and for an estimate of all monthly utility costs. This will be a big help in your budgeting.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h3>12. When were the home’s major utilities last updated?</h3> <p>You should also know when utilities were last updated, like HVAC units, water heaters, and plumbing systems. Knowing this can help you anticipate repairs and what they may cost.</p> <h3>13. What amenities and locations are within walking distance?</h3> <p>Ask the agent if there are any parks, pools, walking trails, or other neighborhood amenities within walking distance. Get details and recommendations on nearby businesses that are important to you, like coffee shops, bars, restaurants, recreation centers, gyms, or hiking trails.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>These will give you an idea of what your day-to-day life will look like in this neighborhood.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h3>14. Can I see myself living here?</h3> <p>This is one you ask yourself while touring the home. Can you see yourself and your loved ones in the home? Would your furniture and decor match the aesthetics of the property? Do you get good phone reception in the house?<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <p>Think about updates you’d want to make if you bought the house. Decide if those projects are worth the time and if you have the budget for them.<span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p> <h2>Open House Questions By Room</h2> <p>More questions will come up as you tour the house. You’ll want to learn more about each room you enter, especially the ones you know you’ll spend a lot of time in.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Here are a few of the questions to consider asking as you enter each room:<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <h3>Questions to ask in the living spaces</h3> <p>Living spaces include living rooms, dens, and bedrooms.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Ask the following in these areas:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Have these rooms had any major renovations?</li> <li aria-level="1">When was the flooring last updated?</li> <li aria-level="1">When were the rooms last painted?</li> <li aria-level="1">Does the owner have the paint colors and brands on hand?</li> <li aria-level="1">What kind of windows are installed and how old are they?</li> <li aria-level="1">Do all outlets and light features work?</li> <li aria-level="1">Do you have the dimensions for these rooms available?</li> </ul> <h3>Questions to ask in the kitchen</h3> <p>The kitchen is the heart of the home, and you’ll spend quite a bit of time there. Be thorough with your evaluations in this space.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>You should ask:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">When was the kitchen last renovated?</li> <li aria-level="1">Has the kitchen experienced any water or fire damage?</li> <li aria-level="1">What appliances are included in the home’s sale?</li> <li aria-level="1">How old are those appliances?</li> <li aria-level="1">Are the cabinets builder-grade or updated?</li> </ul> <h3>Questions to ask in the bathrooms</h3> <p>When touring the bathrooms, make sure everything works and check for leaks on the faucets and under the sink.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Then ask:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Have there been any major renovations?</li> <li aria-level="1">When were the bathroom appliances last updated?</li> <li aria-level="1">How’s the water pressure in the bathrooms?&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Is there hard or soft water?</li> <li aria-level="1">Are there any drainage issues?</li> <li aria-level="1">Have there been any water leaks in the bathrooms?</li> </ul> <h3>Questions to ask in the basement</h3> <p>Basements are great additions to a home, but they can present unique issues.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>Ask these questions if a home you’re considering has a basement:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Is the basement finished?</li> <li aria-level="1">Have there been any major renovations to the space?</li> <li aria-level="1">Have you had any moisture or mold issues in the basement?</li> <li aria-level="1">What did the seller use the basement for?</li> <li aria-level="1">Does the basement have a sump pump and how old is it?</li> </ul> <h2>Get the Full Scoop</h2> <p>It’s essential to see the big picture when considering a home for purchase. The listing gives you a good idea of a home’s condition, but it only goes so far. Attend an open house, tour the home multiple times, and review questions to ask at an open house to learn as much about the property as you can.</p> <p style="font-size: 18px;">If you’re serious about buying a house, make sure to have your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>mortgage pre-approval</span></a> ready before you start house hunting. Your pre-approval is essential to getting your offer accepted.</p> <p style="font-size: 18px;">Happy homebuying.&nbsp;</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_date><![CDATA[August 11, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Many home buyers are familiar with the services provided by a real estate agent and a mortgage lender, but what does a title company do?&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>The title company performs three key functions in the real estate process:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Determines and eliminates issues that might jeopardize your ownership rights</li> <li aria-level="1">Provides insurance policies to protect the lender and the homeowner</li> <li aria-level="1">Handles closing details and <a href="/learn/what-is-escrow" rel="noopener">escrow</a> accounts</li> </ul> <p>Once you understand what the title company does, it’s simple to work with them to ensure a smooth closing.</p> <h2>Title Search</h2> <p>A title company’s most important task is to search relevant public records to verify who the current owners are and to determine if there are any issues that could impact your ownership rights.</p> <p>Information specific to your property is filed with your county recorder’s office. The title agent will conduct a thorough search of public records to ensure the person who is selling you the property has the right to do so. This seems straightforward, but issues like a divorce decree or the passing of an owner can complicate who can sell the property.</p> <p>A title professional also looks for fraudulent documents, questionable circumstances in previous property transfers, and forged signatures to protect your future ownership rights against issues that happened in the past.</p> <p>The title agent will examine the legal description of the property, the most recent survey, current mortgages, court judgments, and other <a href="https://money.howstuffworks.com/lien.htm" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>liens</span></a>, such as unpaid taxes, unpaid child support, or mechanics’ liens.&nbsp;</p> <p>They will also include whether the property is part of a homeowners association or whether the property has designated <a href="https://info.courthousedirect.com/blog/bid/382216/What-is-the-Difference-between-Easement-and-Right-of-Way" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>rights-of-way or easements</span></a> that could prevent you from building things like swimming pools, sheds, or a garage on certain portions of the property.</p> <p>All this information is compiled in a title report that is sent to your lender who creates a list of all issues that need to be resolved before the property can be legally transferred to you.</p> <h2>Property Surveys</h2> <p>Some states require a <a href="https://www.deeds.com/articles/the-property-survey-do-you-need-one/#:~:text=To%20sum%20up%2C%20having%20a%20property%20survey%20done,A%20survey%20protects%20the%20integrity%20of%20your%20deed." style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>property survey</span></a>.</p> <p>A surveyor will visit the property, map out the exact property lines, and verify that any <a href="/learn/house-styles" rel="noopener">structures on the property</a> are all contained within the boundaries. The surveyor will also see if the neighboring structures are encroaching on the property.</p> <p>If you don’t get a property survey prior to purchasing your home, your new neighbor could demand that you tear down your shed if it falls on their side of the property line. Property surveys are a good idea, even if one isn’t required before purchasing your home.</p> <h2>What Is a House Title?</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/couple-signing-paperwork.jpg" alt="First-time home buyers sitting at a counter and looking over their mortgage documents. The weird part is the fruit plate. The grapes look perfectly arranged but the oranges appear to be cut in half and placed face down, and - I mean - who leaves a waxy-coated lemon on the fruit plate to just contaminate everything else with citrus? " loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p>A house title is the bundle of legal rights you have to the home or land you purchase.</p> <p>These rights include being able to <a href="/learn/curb-appeal-ideas" rel="noopener"><span>make landscaping changes</span></a>, make interior and exterior improvements, and even being able to sell the property when you wish. In some cases, you may have the rights to oil or minerals below the surface or access to waterways.</p> <p>While a title refers to the rights you have in the property, a <a href="https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/buying-a-home/what-are-property-deeds.html#:~:text=Deeds%20in%20their%20most%20basic%20form%20contain%3A%201,signature%20of%20the%20person%20transferring%20the%20real%20estate" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>deed</span></a> is the actual legal document used to transfer the property. The deed includes a description of the property and the parties involved in the transfer.</p> <h2>What is Title Insurance?</h2> <p>A title company provides insurance to both the lender and the homeowner.</p> <p>The lender’s policy protects the value of the mortgage for the length of time the lender holds the mortgage on your property. The owner’s policy protects you for the length of time you own the home.</p> <p>While homeowner’s insurance protects you against things that happen in the future, title insurance protects you from things that happened in the past. This is why you only pay one premium for title insurance at the time of the closing, instead of ongoing monthly or yearly payments.</p> <h3>How does title insurance protect your ownership rights?</h3> <p>Many issues could arise after a property changes hands that could impact ownership rights.</p> <p>From property line disputes to unknown heirs showing up to claim the property, your title insurance policy means that the title company will defend you in court against these claims and reimburse you for your equity in the property in the case any claims are valid.</p> <h3>How much does title insurance cost?</h3> <p>The cost of title insurance is based on the <a href="/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for" rel="noopener">amount of the mortgage</a> or the value of the home.</p> <p>Depending on your state, title fees are either set by the Department of Insurance or determined by the title companies themselves.</p> <p>The important thing to remember is that this is a one-time fee paid at closing that protects you for the length of time you own the property.</p> <h2>How Do I Choose a Title Company?</h2> <p>If you don’t know a title agent, ask your lender or real estate agent for a recommendation.</p> <p>As with anything you shop for, ask friends and family who own homes and check reviews online. Compare years of experience, inquire about services offered, and ask what they charge for each of those services.</p> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <h3>How do title companies make money?</h3> <p>Title companies collect fees for the work they do throughout the purchase transaction and will also collect a one-time insurance premium for providing title insurance to the buyer and the lender.</p> <h3>Is a title company necessary?</h3> <p>If you’re getting a mortgage loan, a title company is necessary for your purchase transaction. The only time a title company is not necessary is when the property is located in a jurisdiction that doesn’t require one and when the buyer is paying cash.</p> <h3>What services does a title company provide?</h3> <p>Title companies provide the title search and title insurance necessary for your home purchase. The title search looks for title defects like errors in public records, unknown liens, and forgeries. Your title insurance policy will protect you against any past title defects if they arise in the future.</p> <p>So, what does a title company do? Title companies aren’t talked about often in the purchase process, but they do a lot to keep your home purchase safe and secure. Chat with your real estate team and friends and family to find a local title company you trust.</p> <p>Happy homebuying.</p> <script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How do title companies make money?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Title companies collect fees for the work they do throughout the purchase transaction and will also collect a one-time insurance premium for providing title insurance to the buyer and the lender."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a title company necessary?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you’re getting a mortgage loan, a title company is necessary for your purchase transaction.

Consider <a href="/start" rel="noopener">home buyer education</a> if you're a first-time buyer to hit the ground running.</p> <p>Here is everything you need to make the best offer on a house.</p> <h2>Step 1: Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage</h2> <p class="callout">A pre-approval is a dress rehearsal for your mortgage. It uses your actual income and credit info to calculate how much home you qualify for and provides proof that you’re qualified to buy the home.</p> <p>The first step to making an offer on a house is to get pre-approved for your mortgage.&nbsp;</p> <p>To get <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>pre-approved</span></a>, you’ll provide some basic income and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit information</span></a>, as well as the estimated purchase price you’re looking at. Once the lender reviews the numbers, you’ll receive details like interest rate, closing cost estimates, monthly payment amount, and the purchase price you qualify for. You’ll also get your pre-approval letter.</p> <p>Always include your pre-approval letter when making an offer on a house. This shows sellers that you have the financing necessary to follow through on your offer.</p> <p>Make sure you’re getting a pre-approval and not a pre-qualification. Pre-qualifications don’t require a credit check, making them inaccurate and unreliable.</p> <p>Most sellers only entertain offers that include a pre-approval letter.</p> <h2>Step 2: Find the Right Home for You</h2> <p>Once you’re pre-approved, it’s time to begin the home search. Start by browsing listings online, setting up listing alerts on various real estate platforms, and working with your real estate agent to schedule tours and attend open houses.</p> <p>When you find a home you’re interested in, dig deep into the data. To make the best, most competitive offer, you’ll want to know:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>How long it’s been on the market:</strong> Typically, the longer a home has been listed, the less competition there is for it. This could mean more negotiating power.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>How long the current owner has lived there:</strong> Long-time homeowners may have an emotional attachment to the home making them less likely to accept a lower price or be more selective of the person who buys the property.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>If it’s been renovated or expanded:</strong> Ask your agent for the seller’s disclosures on the property, and check with the city permitting office to see if renovations or expansions were made. Depending on what you find, this could affect your offer price.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>What the neighborhood is like:</strong> Have a good handle on the neighborhood, including its amenities, location, proximity to stores and businesses, and its school district. Look at recent home sales in the area, too. This can help guide you toward an appropriate offer price.</li> </ul> <p>The more informed you are about a property, its location, and its history, the better your offer will be. Remember, you’re not alone in this. Your real estate agent is an expert in this area, so allow them to guide you along the way.</p> <h2>Step 3: Calculate How Much to Offer on a House</h2> <p>Determining the right price to offer can be a challenge, and there are a few things to consider.</p> <h3>Research the home and its history</h3> <p>Understanding how long the seller has owned the home and how long it’s been listed can help you. Typically, if the house has been on the market for a while, the seller will be more eager to sell. This could mean more room for negotiation. If the home was recently listed, the seller is more likely to hold out for the highest price.<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <p>You can find a lot about a home in its listing and public property records. If you attend an open house, you can also ask questions there. The listing agent or someone from their brokerage will be on site.</p> <h3>Know the local market and home comps</h3> <p>Have your real estate agent gather sales data from other homes in the area. This will give you an idea of what similar properties are selling for and point you in the right direction.</p> <p>Also, consider the local housing market. Ask your agent if it’s a buyer’s market or a seller’s market to get an idea of how much room you have to negotiate.</p> <h3>Stick to your budget</h3> <p>You get pre-approved for the purchase price you can qualify for, but that’s not always the amount you can afford. That decision is up to you.</p> <p>Put together a detailed budget using your take-home income and all monthly expenses. This will make it simple to determine how much home you want to buy.</p> <p>Once you know your budget, stick to it. This will ensure that you’re comfortable with your competitive offer.</p> <h2>Step 4: Decide Your Earnest Money Offer</h2> <p>An earnest money deposit is an amount of up-front cash you put into the transaction that you forfeit to the seller if you back out of the deal for reasons that aren’t covered in your contingencies.</p> <p>This money comes from your down payment funds, so it’s not extra cash you need to save.</p> <p>Earnest money deposits can vary but are typically in the 1 to 2 percent range. This can help your offer stand out from others and will show the seller you’re serious.</p> <h2>Step 5: Consider Your Contingencies</h2> <p>Contingencies are clauses you put in your offer to protect yourself. They allow you to back out of the transaction without losing your earnest money deposit or facing legal issues.<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <p>There are five types of contingencies:<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <ol> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Home inspection:</strong> You’ll want to get a home inspection performed on the property before closing. This contingency allows you to renegotiate or back out of the deal entirely if it reveals serious issues.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Appraisal</strong>: This contingency allows you to renegotiate or exit the transaction if the home’s appraised value is less than what you’ve offered.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Financing: </strong>This contingency lets you back out if your mortgage loan falls through.&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Home sale: </strong>This one is for buyers who are also selling their current property. It says that you agree to buy the seller’s house, but not until your existing home sells.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Title</strong>: Under this contingency, you can leave the deal if there are issues with the property’s title.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>Since contingencies mean more risk for the seller, waiving some of them can make your offer more competitive. Make sure you talk to your agent before doing this, though. Waiving contingencies is seldom recommended and could have serious repercussions.</p> <h2>Step 6: Write Your Initial Offer</h2> <p>Next, it’s time to write up your offer. Your real estate agent will do the heavy lifting here, but you’ll need to look it over and sign it before submitting it to the seller.<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <p>Your offer should include:<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The name of the seller&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">The address of the property</li> <li aria-level="1">The names of anyone who will be on the title, including yourself</li> <li aria-level="1">The purchase price you’re offering and down payment</li> <li aria-level="1">The earnest money deposit</li> <li aria-level="1">Any contingencies you’d like to include</li> <li aria-level="1">Any concessions you’re requesting from the seller</li> <li aria-level="1">A complete list of fees and closing costs</li> <li aria-level="1">The dates you’d like to close on the home</li> <li aria-level="1">Your preferred <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move-in</span></a> dates for the home</li> <li aria-level="1">A deadline to respond to the offer</li> </ul> <p>Real estate contracts vary by state, so there may be other items required where you live. Regardless, make sure you review it closely and ensure all info is correct and nothing is left blank. Your agent or a real estate attorney can help ensure your offer complies with local laws and regulations.</p> <h2>Step 7: Negotiate the Price and Terms of the Sale</h2> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVmdeTkraZc" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After you’ve submitted your offer, the seller can either accept it, reject it, or make a counteroffer.</p> <p>If the seller accepts your offer, then congratulations!</p> <p>If the seller rejects your offer, it’s time to start looking for another property. Use this experience to help guide your next offer.</p> <h3>When a seller gives a counteroffer</h3> <p>You have a few choices should the seller make a counteroffer. You can accept the offer as-is, make your own counteroffer, or decline the counteroffer and move on.</p> <p>If you decide to negotiate and make a counteroffer, know that it’s not uncommon to go through several rounds of negotiations before reaching an offer that both parties are happy with.</p> <p>Keep in mind that you can negotiate more than the price. You can remove contingencies, change your closing date, or offer a lease-back, which means the seller can rent the home back from you while they search for a new property.</p> <p>These negotiations are where your real estate agent will shine.</p> <h2>Step 8: Finalize and Sign the Contract</h2> <p>Once you and the seller agree, you’ll finalize the contract, and both parties will sign it.</p> <p>Then you’ll send this contract to your mortgage lender to continue the mortgage process where your pre-approval left off. Your lender will order the appraisal, and you can set up your home inspection.</p> <h2>Real Estate Offer FAQs</h2> <h3>How much should you offer on a house?</h3> <p>The right offer depends on several factors, including how competitive the local housing market is, how long the home’s been on the market, and the number of other buyers interested in the property. Comparable sales can give you an idea of what a home may be worth, but make sure to stay on budget and never offer more than you can comfortably afford.</p> <h3>How do you make the best offer on a house?</h3> <p>Knowing the local housing market, the seller’s situation, and the home’s history can all help you craft the best offer possible. Do your research and work closely with your real estate agent to get all the info you can. Your agent can also consult with the seller’s agent to get more information about their motivations and ideal timeline.</p> <h3>What do you need to make an offer on a house?</h3> <p>To make an official offer on a house, you’ll need:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The seller’s name, home’s address, and the name of everyone you intend to sign the deed</li> <li aria-level="1">The price you’re offering</li> <li aria-level="1">Your down payment amount</li> <li aria-level="1">Your earnest money deposit amount</li> <li aria-level="1">Your mortgage pre-approval letter</li> <li aria-level="1">Any contingencies you want to include</li> <li aria-level="1">Your preferred closing and move-in dates</li> <li aria-level="1">A deadline to review the offer</li> </ul> <p>Your real estate agent or attorney can draft the offer on your behalf, but they will need your input on price, down payment, earnest money, and other details.</p> <h3>Is it rude to lowball an offer on a house?</h3> <p>If the offer is based on research, data, and comparable sales, it’s not rude to make an offer lower than the home’s listing price. Just be prepared for a counteroffer or, in some cases, a rejection.</p> <p>If you make an unjustifiably low offer that isn’t based on local data, you may offend the seller and see your offer rejected or ignored.</p> <h2>How to make an offer on a house</h2> <p>If you want to buy a house, follow our top three tips:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Work on your budget</li> <li aria-level="1">Know what you can afford</li> <li aria-level="1">Get pre-approved for your mortgage loan.</li> </ul> <p>Making an offer on a house may be a new experience, but it’s not hard.

Assuming You Need 20 Percent Down</h2> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/median-down-payment.png" alt="First-time home buyers make a median 6% down payment. " loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></span></strong></p> <p>There’s a common misconception in finance and real estate that you need a 20 percent down payment to buy a house, but it’s not true.&nbsp;</p> <p>A larger down payment can get you a better rate, lower your monthly payment, and increase your equity, so it’s a great choice if you can afford it. Otherwise, you can buy a home with as little as 3 percent down or choose to <a href="/learn/100-mortgage-financing" rel="noopener">finance your whole mortgage</a>. Different loans have varying credit score and down payment requirements, and none of them start at 20 percent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Decide what down payment amount is right for you based on your personal financial goals and budget. You don’t want to devote all of your savings to a down payment, so don’t be discouraged by other buyers’ large down payments.&nbsp;</p> <a id="startsaving" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>2. Waiting To Start Saving</h2> <p>Saving early allows you to contribute more money overall, and can earn you more with interest from savings accounts. You’ll need cash up-front to cover your down payment and closing costs at least.&nbsp;</p> <p>Create a separate account for your home-buying savings so you know exactly how much you have to contribute to your house. Automatic deposits can help you stay on track and grow your savings without having to remember when to contribute and how much.&nbsp;</p> <a id="down-payment-only" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>3. Saving For a Down Payment Only</h2> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/home-closing-costs.png" alt="Chart shows examples of a typical home's closing costs. " loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></span></strong></p> <p>Your down payment will account for most of your home savings goals, but it’s not the only cost to consider.</p> <p>You’ll be responsible for several closing costs when you buy a home. Closing costs can include these expenses:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Down payment — at least 3% of the home’s purchase price</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee"><span>Loan origination fees</span></a> — 1% of the home’s purchase price</li> <li aria-level="1">Title insurance — varies by location</li> <li aria-level="1">Homeowner’s insurance — 1 year of premiums</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi"><span>Private mortgage insurance</span></a> — up-front premium or monthly payments</li> <li aria-level="1">Property tax — 6 months&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="/learn/what-is-escrow" rel="noopener">Escrow</a> fees — 2% of the home’s purchase price</li> </ul> <p>You also want to save money for your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move-in plan</span></a>. This may just be a couple hundred dollars for professional movers. You may also want to install a fence or purchase new kitchen appliances. You’ll be able to better estimate your moving costs once you choose a house, but anticipate these extra expenses from the beginning.&nbsp;</p> <a id="more-than-you-can-afford" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>4. Buying More Home Than You Can Afford</h2> <p>Receiving a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for"><span>mortgage pre-approval</span></a> for a larger loan than you expected is exciting, but that doesn’t mean you should take out a mortgage that large. You know how much you can afford to pay on housing each month better than your lender does.&nbsp;</p> <p>Create a budget considering your monthly income, recurring expenses, and savings goals to determine how much house you can afford. Buying more house than you can comfortably afford may generate homeownership stress and make it hard to meet your other financial goals.</p> <p>If you think you can afford more than you currently pay in rent, try following that budget for a few months and contribute the extra housing cost to your savings. You’ll see if it’s a comfortable amount to spend on housing and how it impacts your finances before making the commitment.&nbsp;</p> <a id="credit-check" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>5. Skipping a Personal Credit Check</h2> <p>Your lender will check your credit report as part of the pre-approval process, so some home buyers may not see the need to check it themselves. Check your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score</span></a> so you know what loans you’re eligible for to help you make the best personal choice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Checking your credit report also gives you the chance to identify and correct any mistakes, and resolve any negative marks on your report. You can also work to improve your credit to earn a lower rate and more loan options.&nbsp;</p> <a id="single-lender" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>6. Consulting With a Single Lender</h2> <p>Explore your lending options and talk with multiple mortgage lenders to shop for the best deals. Different lenders and brokers can offer varying interest rates and mortgage amounts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your lender will also be a valuable resource for home-buying education and professional recommendations, so consider which lenders you work well with and trust.&nbsp;</p> <a id="first-time-home-buyer-assistance" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>7. Missing Out on First-Time Home Buyer Assistance</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/first-time-home-buyer-education-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="First-time home buyers who get homebuyer education are more likely to be satisfied with their home-buying process - homebuyer.com"></p> <p>Several federal and state housing programs provide <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant"><span>down payment assistance</span></a> and other benefits for first-time home buyers. Some of the programs require first-time home buyer education, which can also provide you with the knowledge you need to buy your first home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Explore your local, state, and federal opportunities for first-time home buyers.&nbsp;</p> <a id="pre-qualification" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>8. Getting Mortgage Pre-Qualification Without Pre-Approval</h2> <p>Mortgage pre-qualification can provide you an estimate of what loans and rates you’re eligible for, but it’s not a guarantee. A mortgage pre-approval letter guarantees a mortgage amount and interest rate, and gives you buying power to submit an offer on a house. If you’re serious about home-buying, you want a mortgage pre-approval letter.&nbsp;</p> <a id="real-estate-agent" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>9. Hiring the Only Real Estate Agent You Meet</h2> <p>Your real estate agent is another important member of your home-buying team. They’ll understand your local housing market and can help you tour homes, submit an offer, and negotiate your contract.&nbsp;</p> <p>An experienced buyer’s agent will help you secure a great deal while avoiding home-buying stress, so it’s important you have someone you trust. Interview a few real estate agents to get to know them and hire the agent you work best with and who has the local expertise you’re looking for.&nbsp;</p> <a id="long-term-plan" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>10. Buying Without a Long-Term Plan</h2> <p>Buying a home is a large investment and you want to stay long enough to build equity. Your first home doesn’t have to be a forever home, but having a long-term plan can help you choose a house that fits your lifestyle goals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Balance long-term needs, like a growing family or career goals, with what you can afford and what’s available in the communities you tour. Good local schools and parks are great if you’re planning to have kids, while public transportation and local industry may be more valuable for your career.&nbsp;</p> <a id="neighborhood-tour" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>11. Skipping a Neighborhood Tour Before You Buy</h2> <p>Moving to a new home includes moving to a new community, so it's a good idea to <a href="/learn/how-to-meet-your-neighbors" rel="noopener">greet potential neighbors</a>. Be sure to check out the home’s neighborhood before you buy to make sure it’s a good fit for your lifestyle.&nbsp;</p> <p>You want to know what entertainment options are available locally, including pools, restaurants, parks, or museums. It’s a good idea to also check the distance to the grocery store, your office, and the hospital to anticipate travel time and costs.&nbsp;</p> <a id="open-house" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>12. Sharing Too Much Information at the Open House</h2> <p>Open houses are an opportunity to see the home and envision your life there. You get to see every room of the house and imagine working in your home office or welcoming guests for a dinner party.&nbsp;</p> <p>The open house is a good time to talk with the seller’s agent and learn more about the house, too. You can ask about the neighborhood, why the seller is moving, and what their timeline is like. This information can help you make an offer and negotiate the contract.&nbsp;</p> <p>The seller’s agent will also be able to learn about you and your interests in a house, which they can use when negotiating. Sharing how much you love the back garden or a home’s <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/curb-appeal-ideas"><span>curb appeal</span></a> can show your excitement and help you win your bid, but you may not want to disclose details like how much you’re willing to offer.</p> <a id="home-inspection" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>13. Passing On a Home Inspection</h2> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/homeowners-save-an-average-of-14k.png" alt="Should you get a home inspection when you buy a house? It depends on whether $14,000 matters to you, you know?" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></span></strong></p> <p>Home inspectors will evaluate a house to identify major structural issues, home repairs, and the condition of included appliances. Their goal is to make sure the home is liveable and that everyone fully understands the house’s condition before the sale is finalized.</p> <p>Home buyers may skip an inspection to save money and time up-front while creating an attractive offer for the seller. It can help you win the bid in a competitive market, but it can become a costly mistake if you find significant damage after you close, especially when you consider that <a href="https://porch.com/resource/home-inspection-leverage"><span>86 percent</span></a> of home inspectors find at least one needed repair.</p> <p>Talk to your real estate agent and friends and family for home inspector recommendations. You can use the home inspector’s report to make sure the house is a good fit and negotiate any needed repairs.&nbsp;</p> <a id="regulationg-emotions" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>14. Making Decisions Without Regulating Emotions</h2> <p>Buying your first home is an emotional experience and it can be hard not to let your excitement take over. It’s also a large investment that you should make rationally considering your personal needs and finances.&nbsp;</p> <p>Create a list of needs and wants so you can judge a house and community by how it realistically fits your lifestyle. Stick to your budget and talk the purchase over with your real estate team or a friend for an additional perspective.&nbsp;</p> <a id="local-market" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>15. Assuming You Know the Local Market</h2> <p>Your real estate agent can provide you with a local comparative market analysis (CMA) to inform your offer letter and negotiations.&nbsp;</p> <p>A CMA compares recently sold and similarly valued homes in your location to determine a fair market value. This process is separate from a home appraisal and tells you how much the home may sell for and how quickly, considering current trends.&nbsp;</p> <a id="new-credit-lines" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>16. Opening or Closing New Credit Lines Before You Buy</h2> <p>After your offer is submitted on a house, the lender will perform a final credit check before providing the mortgage loan. New credit inquiries or lines of credit could impact your mortgage total and rates, potentially delaying the closing.</p> <p>Closing old lines of credit can also negatively impact your credit score. It’s good to pay off your debt, but don’t close any credit until the deal is finished. Delay any new large purchases until after you own your home.&nbsp;</p> <a id="FAQ" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Advice for First-Time Home Buyers: Questions From Our Chat Box</h2> <h3>I’m ready to buy a house. How do I start?</h3> <p>Get a <a href="/nurla" rel="noopener"><span>mortgage pre-approval</span></a> to see how much mortgage you qualify for and estimate your monthly payments. This also gives you buying power to submit an offer when you find a house you love.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mortgage pre-approvals are valid for 90 days, so be sure you’re ready to buy before pre-approval. These are easy to renew, however, if you need more than 90 days to choose a home.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Can first-time home buyers avoid a down payment?</h3> <p>Lenders do require some down payment to secure their loan, but you have options. Some mortgages accept as little as 3 percent down and some lenders are more flexible than others.&nbsp;</p> <p>You may also be eligible for first-time home buyer assistance. Some programs offer grants, interest-free loans, or <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/15000-first-time-home-buyer-tax-credit"><span>tax credits</span></a> to make home-buying accessible.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How much does the average first-time home buyer put down?</h3> <p>First-time home buyers contribute a <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-downpayment-expectations-and-hurdles-to-homeownership-report-04-16-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>median 6 percent down payment</span></a>. The average home buyer puts a median 12 percent down on their home purchase.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How do you prove you’re a first-time home buyer?</h3> <p>Your loan officer will explore your credit report and assets when you apply for a loan or pre-approval. This report will show if you’ve owned a home in the last three years.</p> <h2>Emotions When Buying Your First Home</h2> <p>Buying your first home is an exciting step in life that offers stability, comfort, and financial benefits. It’s where you’ll welcome family for holiday dinners, celebrate big wins with your friends, and watch your family grow all under one roof.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enjoy the <a href="/learn/positive-home-buying-experience" rel="noopener">special home buying experience</a> without feeling overwhelmed.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Buying a house in your early 20s is easier than you think, and it happens every day.</p> <!--more--> <p>According to the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-housing.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Federal Reserve</span></a>, 26% of Americans 18 to 29 owned their own home in 2019. And the National Association of Realtors shows that 14% of all homebuyers were aged 22 to 30 in 2020.</p> <p>If you’re in your early 20s, here’s how to make your homebuying dreams come true.</p> <p>Table of Contents:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span style="color: #5462d1;"><a href="#benefits" rel="noopener" style="color: #5462d1;">Homeownership Benefits in Your 20s</a></span></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#what-to-know" rel="noopener">What to Know When Buying a House Young</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="#how-to-buy-a-house-in-your-early-20s" rel="noopener">How to Buy a House In Your 20s</a></li> </ul> <a id="benefits" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Homeownership Benefits in Your 20s&nbsp;</h2> <p>There are many advantages to buying your first house while you’re young. Here are some of the most significant benefits young homeowners enjoy:</p> <h3>Building your own wealth — not your landlord’s</h3> <p>When you rent, your money goes toward your landlord’s mortgage — not your own. It doesn’t help you build wealth, nor do you see any of it back as the house builds equity.</p> <p>As a homeowner, every monthly mortgage payment goes toward your loan balance. This builds equity that’s yours. And when you have enough equity in your home, you can turn it into cash with a home equity loan or refinance. Many homeowners do this to renovate their property or pay for sudden bills or expenses.</p> <p>More equity also means more profits when you sell the home.</p> <h3>You can customize your house to fit your tastes</h3> <p>As a renter, you’re limited when it comes to decorating and customizing your home. You typically can’t upgrade or renovate, and you may be limited to specific paint colors and light fixtures.</p> <p>Homeowners have control over their property’s look and aesthetic. You can paint and decorate as you wish, and you can update your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/curb-appeal-ideas"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #5462d1; text-decoration: underline;">curb appeal</span></span></a>, landscaping, and exterior elements whenever you like.&nbsp;</p> <p>You also have the freedom to make more significant renovations, like tearing down a wall to open the floor plan or installing something fun — like a swimming pool in the backyard. These changes will impact your home’s value, so choosing updates carefully can raise the value of your home and build additional equity.</p> <h3>You can pay off your home earlier in life</h3> <p>The sooner you buy a home, the sooner you can pay it off — and that means some serious financial freedom not far down the road.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mortgages are typically paid off in 15 to 30 years. Once paid off, your monthly housing payment goes away. The only costs that remain are your property taxes and applicable homeowners association dues.</p> <p>This allows you to invest more, travel, or even retire. Buying a house in your early 20s puts you on schedule for this to happen near your 50th birthday. The national average retirement age is 67, so this puts you way ahead of the game.</p> <a id="what-to-know" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What to Know When Buying a House Young&nbsp;</h2> <p>Despite its benefits, homeownership isn’t something you should jump into blindly. Buying a house is a big financial decision, and you’ll want to educate yourself before you begin.</p> <h3>Buying a house has upfront costs</h3> <p>Your up-front costs come in the form of down payment and closing costs. You can buy a home with as little as a three percent down payment. Closing costs include things like your appraisal and <span style="color: #5462d1;"><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-loan-origination-fee" style="color: #5462d1;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">loan origination fees</span></a></span>, and those average about 2 percent of your loan balance.</p> <p>Don’t forget moving costs, either. Even if it’s just pizza and drinks for the family and friends that lend a hand.</p> <h3>House hunting is a process</h3> <p>You’ll want to fine-tune your budget and find a trusted real estate agent before you start house hunting. Above all else, you must <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup" style="color: #0000ff;"><span><span style="color: #5462d1;">get pre-approved for your mortgage</span></span></a>. Home sellers won’t take your offer seriously unless your pre-approval letter is included.</p> <p>The pre-approval process is simple and is a great place to start.</p> <p>Most purchase transactions take 30-45 days, depending on the wants and needs of the seller. The waiting game isn’t always easy, but your patience will be rewarded.</p> <a id="how-to-buy-a-house-in-your-early-20s" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How to Buy a House in Your 20s</h2> <p>If buying a house in your early 20s sounds like the right move for you, we’re here to help you make it happen. Just follow the <a href="/learn/timeline-for-buying-a-house/" rel="noopener">home buying steps</a> below.</p> <h3>1. Start saving now</h3> <p>Begin saving as soon as you decide to buy a home. The more money you can bank, the better.</p> <p>Saving is done best when you put together a plan and stick to it. Choose an amount you’d like to save every month and set up a direct deposit to a savings account so it happens automatically.</p> <p>It only takes a 3% down payment to buy a home, but having some extra cash on hand for closing costs or home repairs is a good idea. Pick your target amount and go for it.</p> <h3>2. Explore your finances</h3> <p>Take a few minutes to <span style="color: #5462d1;"><a href="https://youtu.be/_V2c8-ZjjB4" style="color: #5462d1;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">put together a budget</a></span>.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you’re pre-approved for a mortgage, the bank calculates things based on your pre-tax income and the bills that show up on your credit report. This makes it easier to qualify and shows you how much home you <em>can</em> buy.</p> <p>An effective budget will be based on your take-home income and include monthly payments like phone and data plans, utility bills, and living expenses that don’t show up on your credit report. This will give you a real-world look at your financial situation so you can determine how much home you <em>want </em>to buy.</p> <p>Your budget also identifies places where you may be overspending, so it’s easy to cut back where you need to.</p> <h3>3. Get pre-approved</h3> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-long-is-a-mortgage-pre-approval-good-for"><span>Getting pre-approved</span></a> will accomplish many things. You will:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Find out what size loan you qualify for</li> <li aria-level="1">Get a clear picture of your credit in case anything needs to be improved or worked on</li> <li aria-level="1">Explore loan programs and interest rates that are available to you</li> <li aria-level="1">Get your pre-approval letter, so you’re ready for house hunting</li> </ul> <p>Your pre-approval letter shows you’re committed and ready to buy when you submit an offer on a house.&nbsp;</p> <h3>4. Decide what housing situation is right for you</h3> <p>Next, you’ll decide <a href="https://youtu.be/jQnTE047S6g" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>what kind of house is right for you</span></a>.</p> <p>Single-family homes, condos, townhomes and multi-unit properties are all options. Once you’ve picked one of those, you’ll choose what <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #5462d1; text-decoration: underline;">home style</span></span></a> is right for you.</p> <p>Last, think about amenities and put together a “must haves” list. Do you need a yard and <span style="color: #5462d1;"><a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/home-buying-guide-pet-parents" style="color: #5462d1;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pet-friendly neighborhood</span></a></span>? Maybe you’re looking for something more walkable or on a busy street with retail, restaurants, and entertainment nearby.</p> <p>Make your list as detailed as possible. Your real estate agent will thank you.</p> <h3>5. Choose a real estate agent</h3> <p>A trusted real estate agent will make <a href="/start" rel="noopener">buying your first home</a> as simple as possible.</p> <p>They’ll help you find homes that fit your budget and needs, schedule showings, draw up your contracts, and negotiate on your behalf.&nbsp;</p> <p>They also have local experience, which can help you target the perfect property and steer clear of the duds.</p> <p>Ask your friends, family members, colleagues, or your lender for agent recommendations. Make sure to read reviews before deciding who to go with. Don’t be afraid to interview several options before choosing your agent; they play an essential role in how smooth your home buying process is.</p> <h3>6. Begin house hunting</h3> <p>Once you have an agent, a pre-approval letter, and a budget, it’s time to begin searching for your first home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Set up listing alerts so you’re in the know each time a home that meets your needs hits the market. If it feels like the one, work with your agent to submit an offer as quickly as possible, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JVmdeTkraZc" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><span style="color: #5462d1;">get ready to negotiate</span></span></a>.</p> <p>Once your offer is accepted, you’re close to becoming a homeowner. Let your lender know your offer was accepted, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ARE_c8_6dI" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>schedule your inspection</span></a>, and start packing those boxes. You’ll have keys to your dream house in just a few weeks.</p> <h2>At what age can you buy a house?</h2> <p>There’s no minimum age to buy a house. If you’re ready and have a down payment, buying a house in your early 20s is a smart move.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to buy a home young, start planning now and get in touch to let us know what you need. We’re here to help.</p> <p>Happy homebuying.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whatIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What is a Mortgage Pre-approval?</h2> <p>A mortgage pre-approval is a dress rehearsal for your actual mortgage.</p> <!--more--> <p>The pre-approval process considers your financial situation (<a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score</span></a>, income, assets, etc.) to determine the loan size and interest rate you’re eligible for. Plus, you’ll receive an estimated monthly housing payment, which is essential for budgeting.</p> <p>Pre-approvals let buyers know exactly how much home they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> buy and provide the information necessary to determine how much home they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want to</span> buy.</p> <p>Pre-approvals are also required for house hunting.

All these things can affect your maximum purchase price — for better or worse.</p> <p>If you haven’t yet found a home when you’re close to that 90-day window, contact your mortgage expert and tell them you’d like to get your pre-approval refreshed.</p> <p>You’ll provide some updated documentation; they’ll refresh your credit report and go over all the details again. If there are positive, negative, or no changes at all, they’ll let you know.

		<post_title><![CDATA[LPMI vs. PMI: Is Lender-Paid Private Mortgage Insurance Right For you?]]></post_title>
		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/lpmi-vs.-pmi]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[July 2, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required with conventional mortgage loans when you put down less than 20 percent on your home purchase. PMI helps lenders mitigate risk to offer low-down payment purchase financing and is why three percent down payment programs exist.</p> <!--more--> <p>PMI is traditionally paid monthly. While it adds a small premium to your monthly payments, it doesn’t last forever. You can cancel these premiums once you have enough equity in your home.</p> <p>An alternative to monthly PMI payments is lender-paid private mortgage insurance (LPMI). With LPMI, your lender handles the mortgage insurance payments. However, this is not a no-cost option and typically results in a higher interest rate.</p> <p>Read on to learn more about LPMI vs. PMI or <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>apply to get pre-approved</span></a> for your mortgage loan now.</p> <h2>What is LPMI?</h2> <p class="callout">Lender-paid private mortgage insurance (LPMI) is a type of PMI that is arranged and paid for by your mortgage lender. You’ll typically pay for this service with a higher interest rate.</p> <p>With lender-paid private mortgage insurance, your mortgage insurance is either built into the closing costs or paid via a higher interest rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lenders can negotiate lower premiums in bulk than a home buyer could on a single PMI policy, so LPMI is often cheaper than monthly PMI payments. However, LPMI policies cannot be canceled. You must pay off the loan or refinance to drop the insurance — and the higher rate it comes with.</p> <p>LPMI often results in a lower monthly payment, though it may cost more in the long run.</p> <h2>What is PMI?</h2> <p class="callout">Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance policy that mitigates the lender’s risk, allowing them to offer low-down-payment purchase financing.</p> <p>Private Mortgage Insurance is a type of insurance required on conventional loans when you put down less than 20 percent on a home purchase. The home buyer pays the monthly premium, and the insurance reduces the lender’s risk to provide purchase financing with as little as 3 percent down.</p> <h3>Four Types of PMI</h3> <p>There are four ways to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance. Your options will typically depend on what your lender offers.</p> <p>Private Mortgage Insurance can be purchased as:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Borrower-paid monthly PMI</strong> — Default monthly PMI option that can be cancelled when you build 20 percent home equity.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Borrower-paid single-premium PMI </strong>— Allows the buyer to pay the insurance premium up-front and is non-refundable.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Borrower-paid split-premium PMI</strong> — Buyer pays a portion of the premium up-front and a reduced monthly payment.</li> <li aria-level="1"><strong>Lender-paid PMI</strong> — Lender-arranged PMI that is via an increased interest rate and cannot be canceled.</li> </ul> <h2>LPMI vs. PMI: The Main Differences&nbsp;</h2> <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; margin: 0px 0px 0px 1px; height: 324px;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 30px;"> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; border-color: #ffffff; height: 30px;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 30px; border: 1px solid #5462d1;"><strong>LPMI</strong></td> <td style="width: 33%; padding: 4px; height: 30px; border: 1px solid #5462d1;"><strong>PMI</strong></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 81px;"> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 81px; border: 1px solid #5462d1; vertical-align: middle;"> <p><span style="color: #000000;">How is this policy paid?</span></p> </td> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1; height: 81px;">Via an increased interest rate.</td> <td style="width: 33%; padding: 4px; height: 81px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Via a monthly premium added to your mortgage payments.</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 52px;"> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 52px; border: 1px solid #5462d1;">Can this policy be canceled?</td> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 52px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">No.</td> <td style="width: 33%; padding: 4px; height: 52px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Yes, once your home equity reaches 20%.</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 107px;"> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 107px; border: 1px solid #5462d1;">Is this policy tax-deductible?</td> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 107px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Yes, if you itemize your returns.&nbsp;</td> <td style="width: 33%; padding: 4px; height: 107px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Maybe. PMI was deductible in 2020, but the policy has yet to be extended for the 2021 tax year.</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 54px;"> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 54px; border: 1px solid #5462d1;">Is the home buyer responsible for this payment?</td> <td style="width: 33.3333%; padding: 4px; height: 54px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Yes.</td> <td style="width: 33%; padding: 4px; height: 54px; border: 1px dashed #5462d1;">Yes.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>The Benefits of Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance</h3> <p>The most significant benefit of LPMI is that it can yield lower monthly payments than borrower-paid PMI.</p> <p>LPMI can be a money-saver for short-term homeowners. If you plan to sell before you have 20 percent equity, you can take the short-term savings and not worry about longer-term costs.</p> <p>Finally, LPMI is fully tax-deductible. LPMI is paid through a higher interest rate. And, when you itemize your returns, mortgage interest is deductible.</p> <h3>The Benefits of Private Mortgage Insurance</h3> <p>Borrower-paid PMI has its benefits, too. For one, it’s more accessible. Every lender has borrower-paid PMI options, but not all offer LPMI.</p> <p>You can also cancel borrower-paid PMI once you reach 20 percent equity in your home. This is great if you plan to be in your home long-term, and you can look forward to a lower payment once you reach 20 percent equity.</p> <p>Remember that your equity rises when home values rise, so you may reach 20 percent equity sooner than expected.</p> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <h3>Is LPMI or PMI better for first-time home buyers?</h3> <p>It depends on how long you plan to stay in the home and what offerings your lender makes available. While LPMI typically gives the lower monthly payment, that’s not always the case. It’s best to work with your trusted mortgage expert to compare all available options.</p> <h3>Which PMI has the lowest risk?</h3> <p>PMI doesn’t lower your risk, so all policies would be the same for you. That said, LPMI can’t be canceled. If you see being tied into PMI as a risk, then a borrower-paid PMI option would be a lower risk for you.</p> <h3>How much does PMI cost?</h3> <p>The cost of PMI varies based on your loan amount, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant"><span>mortgage down payment</span></a>, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit</span></a>, and more. <a href="https://myhome.freddiemac.com/buying/breaking-down-pmi.html#:~:text=While%20PMI%20is%20an%20initial,month%20for%20every%20%24100%2C000%20borrowed." rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>According to Freddie Mac</span></a>, the average is about $30 to $70 per month for every $100,000 you borrow.</p> <h3>Which loans require PMI?</h3> <p>Many types of mortgage loans require mortgage insurance:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Conventional loans with a down payment of less than 20 percent</li> <li aria-level="1">FHA loans require a Mortgage Insurance Premium, regardless of the down payment amount</li> <li aria-level="1">VA loans require a Guarantee Fee, regardless of the down payment amount</li> <li aria-level="1">USDA loans require a Guarantee Fee, regardless of the down payment amount</li> </ul> <h2>The bottom line</h2> <p>PMI comes with many benefits and can help you buy your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span>dream home</span></a> with less money down. If you know you’ll only be in the home for a short while, LPMI can often be the best choice, but if you plan to stay for the long haul, borrower-paid PMI may be a better fit.</p> <p>Always talk to your mortgage expert about your long-term goals and budget. They can give you all of your options and point you in the right direction. <a href="/start" rel="noopener">Home buyer education</a> can also provide the tools you need to buy your first home with confidence.</p> <p>Happy homebuying.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Several fees come along with a mortgage. One of the more typical is the loan origination fee charged by your lender for processing and, sometimes, underwriting your loan.</p> <!--more--> <p>The exact cost of these fees varies from one lender to the next, but they generally clock in at 1% or less of your total loan balance.</p> <p>To get a feel for what your loan origination fee may be, get <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>pre-approved for your mortgage loan</span></a>. This will give you a good idea of your total loan costs — both at closing and long-term.</p> <h2>What Are Loan Origination Fees?</h2> <p class="callout">A loan origination fee is a charge assessed by a mortgage lender to process your loan. It typically amounts to about 1% of your total loan balance.</p> <p>Almost all lenders charge origination fees to cover the cost of processing, underwriting, and executing your loan.&nbsp;</p> <p>These fees can show up as a single origination fee or as several different charges — like an underwriting and processing fee. Origination fees cover a variety of lender-side costs, including things like:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Verifying your employment and income</li> <li aria-level="1">Processing your application and documentation</li> <li aria-level="1">Preparing your mortgage documents</li> <li aria-level="1">Underwriting your loan</li> </ul> <p>Loan origination fees vary. Your loan amount, type of loan, <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score</span></a>, and the presence of a co-signer can all impact costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thankfully, mortgage lenders break these fees down on your <a href="/learn/loan-estimate" rel="noopener">Loan Estimate</a>, which you’ll receive when you get pre-approved. You’ll also get an updated breakdown of your costs no later than three days before closing day.</p> <h3>When do you pay loan origination fees?</h3> <p>You’ll pay your origination fees at closing as part of your total closing costs.</p> <p>Closing costs include other fees like:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Prepaid interest, which covers the interest for the period between closing day and the end of the month.</li> <li aria-level="1">Discount points, which allow you to pay an upfront fee to lower your interest rate.</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, lenders may offer credits to help offset some or all of these costs.</p> <h2>Are Loan Origination Fees Negotiable?</h2> <p>Origination fees and many of the lender-side fees are negotiable, so don’t be afraid to ask your lender to reduce yours. Origination fees can be lowered by:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A simple reduction of the fees by the lender</li> <li aria-level="1">The lender giving a credit to offset a portion, or all, of the origination fees</li> <li aria-level="1">Taking a higher interest rate to reduce your up-front costs</li> </ul> <p>If you are still left with up-front costs, consider asking the seller to contribute to your closing costs. The odds of receiving seller contributions are market-dependent, so be sure to consult with your real estate agent about this.</p> <h3>Compare quotes from different lenders</h3> <p>Mortgage origination fees, rates, terms, and other fees can vary wildly from one mortgage company to the next. It’s essential to get quotes from at least two or three lenders before deciding who to work with. This will allow you to see a wide range of fees and rates and ultimately determine the best choice for you.</p> <p>Getting a few extra quotes will also better prepare you for negotiations. When negotiating fees, showing your mortgage expert a quote from another lender is the perfect way to lower your costs.</p> <h2>Read Your Loan Estimate Carefully</h2> <p>Once you choose a lender, be sure to read your Loan Estimate carefully. It outlines all the fees you’ll be expected to pay at closing, including the origination fee. Though this fee covers many services associated with your loan, they’re often negotiable. Never be afraid to ask your lender for a reduction or credit to offset your costs — especially if you’re a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant"><span>first-time home buyer</span></a>.</p> <p>Loan origination fees are common costs that cover your lender’s work to process your loan. Origination fees are typically just one percent of your loan balance and they’re often negotiable. Talk with your mortgage lender about their origination fee and plan to pay this extra closing cost before you <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move in</span></a>.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Moving out of your parents' home is a major lifetime milestone.</p> <!--more--> <p>When you’re planning to buy your first home, start by <a href="/pre-approval-warmup" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener"><span>getting pre-approved for a mortgage</span></a><span style="color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;">.</span> This will show you what you qualify for and will prepare you for house hunting.</p> <p>There are many other items you’ll want to add to your to-do list, as well. Here are 18 tips that will show you how to move out of your parents’ house:</p> <h2>1. Talk to Your Family</h2> <p>Let your family know that you are ready to move out and discuss your options with them. They may be your best source of advice and assistance.</p> <p>Family and friends who have made moves in the past can put you in touch with the resources you’ll need along the way, such as moving companies, lenders, and real estate agents.</p> <h2>2. Choose a Moving Date</h2> <p>Deadlines are highly motivating. Pick a target move date and commit to it. This will help you focus on checking off your to-do list.</p> <p>This date is your goal, but it’s not set in stone. Your actual moving date can change based on the closing date you and the home seller agree to, but choosing a target date will help you stay on track.</p> <h2>3. Start Saving Money</h2> <p>It’s no secret that moving into your own place costs money.</p> <p>Whether you’re paying a security deposit and first month’s rent or a down payment to buy a house, there will typically be out-of-pocket expenses.</p> <p>The more money you have in savings, the better.</p> <h2>4. Budget for Your New Home</h2> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_V2c8-ZjjB4" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Budgeting for your new home</span></a> will help you decide how much you want your housing payment to be, and it’s one of the most important things you’ll do.</p> <p>To do this, calculate all potential monthly expenses:</p> <ul> <li>Research basic utility costs in the area</li> <li>Know what you spend on car payments, insurance, and gas</li> <li>Track your food and entertainment expenses</li> <li>Account for haircare, clothing, and other services</li> </ul> <p>Once you have your total monthly budget, compare that to your take-home income. This will make it easy to set a target monthly payment for your new housing payment.</p> <h2>5. Build Your Credit</h2> <p>One of the most often asked questions is <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house" style="color: #0563c1;"><span>what credit score you need to buy a house</span></a>. The answer can vary, but a qualifying credit score is typically in the 580-620 range.&nbsp;</p> <p>No matter what your credit looks like, <a href="https://youtu.be/5M4FQOpLwUI" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>there are a few steps you can take to improve it</span></a>:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Check your credit report for errors</li> <li aria-level="1">Settle outstanding debts in collection</li> <li aria-level="1">Don’t acquire new debt</li> <li aria-level="1">Don’t close credit accounts</li> <li aria-level="1">Pay your bills on time</li> <li aria-level="1">Pay down your credit card debt</li> </ul> <p>Some of these may seem obvious, but they are important and can improve your credit score quickly.</p> <h2>6. Get Pre-Approved for Your Mortgage</h2> <p>It’s never too early to <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup" style="color: #0563c1;"><span>get pre-approved.</span></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll complete a simple questionnaire and provide income documentation. This basic information helps the lender determine the size of loan you qualify for. Be sure to inquire about <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant" style="color: #0563c1;"><span>first-time homebuyer programs</span></a> that can assist you with the down payment.</p> <p>The most significant benefit of a pre-approval letter for you is that it allows you to start house hunting with confidence. Plus, home sellers will rarely entertain offers from buyers who aren’t pre-approved, so this will enable you to submit an offer as soon as you find a home you love. Mortgage pre-approvals are good for up to 90 days, but they are simple to refresh if your time frame is a bit longer.</p> <h2>7. Decide Where to Live</h2> <p>Travel around the neighborhoods of your target city to see what areas you’re drawn to.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider your commute distance to work and what amenities are important to you.&nbsp; If you prefer outdoor activities, access to restaurants, theaters, shopping, or all of the above, make sure your target area meets your needs.</p> <p>You’ll also need to pick the <a href="/learn/house-styles" rel="noopener">kind of house</a> you want. Do you want a <a href="https://youtu.be/jQnTE047S6g" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>single-family home, condo, or townhome</span></a>? Do you want <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home" style="color: #0563c1;"><span>a move-in ready house</span></a> or a fixer-upper?</p> <p>Once you narrow things down and pick how many bedrooms and bathrooms you want, you’re ready for house hunting.</p> <h2>8. Choose a Real Estate Agent</h2> <p>Now that you know what you want and how much you can afford, it’s time to find an excellent <a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span>real estate agent</span></a>.</p> <p>Your real estate agent is one of the most valuable members of your home buying team. Each neighborhood and suburb offer various housing options, and a local agent will be familiar with what is available in your price range.</p> <p>They’ll help submit your offer, manage negotiations, and keep you updated on each step along the way.</p> <h2>9. Start Touring Houses</h2> <p>Attend local open houses to see what’s available in the area.</p> <p>Bring a checklist with you to keep track of your must-have and nice-to-have items in each house you see. Some good things to look for during a home tour are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Number and size of bedrooms and bathrooms</li> <li aria-level="1">Kitchen layout and finishings</li> <li aria-level="1">Parking availability</li> <li aria-level="1">Front and back yard preferences</li> <li aria-level="1">Type and condition of the floors</li> <li aria-level="1">Single or dual pane windows</li> <li aria-level="1">Overall layout and how it works with your lifestyle</li> </ul> <p>Also, exploring the neighborhoods will give you the best idea of what it’s like to live there.</p> <h2>10. Join Social Groups Online</h2> <p>If you’re staying in your current location, you may already have a strong social network. If you’re moving to a new city, join some social groups online to get connected and to learn more about the place you’re moving to.</p> <p>In addition to general groups, hunt for specialized groups around your hobbies, interests, or volunteer opportunities like <a href="https://www.habitat.org/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Habitat for Humanity</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joining Facebook groups, Bumble BFF, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Meetup</span></a>, and other social media are all great ways to meet new people.</p> <h2>11. Purchase Your Home</h2> <p>You've found a home you love and decided you're ready to submit an offer — congratulations!</p> <p>The process isn’t over when your offer is accepted, but you’re getting close. Your mortgage expert and your real estate agent will be there to guide you through appraisal, inspection, contingencies, repairs, insurance, and the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-real-estate-closing" style="color: #0563c1;"><span>final closing</span></a>.</p> <h2>12. Select an Official Move Out Day</h2> <p>Your final offer will include an agreed-upon closing date, so you’ll know when you get your keys long in advance. Then you get to choose what day you want to move in.</p> <p>Consider if you want to do any work on the home before you move in. It’s much easier to update a kitchen or paint an empty room before you move, so plan accordingly.</p> <h2>13. Declutter and Donate Extra Items</h2> <p>Don’t wait until your move date to declutter and get rid of things you don’t want. Do this right away.</p> <p>Divide your belongings into three categories: keep, sell, and donate. <a href="https://www.goodwill.org/donate/donate-stuff/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Goodwill Industries</span></a> and the <a href="https://salvationarmy.org/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Salvation Army</span></a> are two great organizations that will gladly take your usable items.</p> <p>Move the unwanted items on to their new owners as soon as possible. You’ll be happy you’re not carrying unneeded items into your new living space.</p> <h2>14. Start Packing</h2> <p>As you sort through things, go ahead and start packing.</p> <p>Begin with seasonal clothing, books, memorabilia, and any household items you won’t need in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Most importantly, label boxes by room. Using color codes, numbers, or clearly marked labels will ensure that boxes are placed in the appropriate room during the move.</p> <h2>15. Schedule your move</h2> <p>Are you planning a do-it-yourself move? Give family and friends plenty of notice when asking for their help.</p> <p>If you want a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/moving/how-to-choose-a-reliable-moving-company/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>professional mover</span></a>, schedule them as soon as possible. If you are moving locally, the mover will move everything over on the same day.</p> <p>If you are planning a DIY move, it may take a bit longer.</p> <h2>16. Call to Set-up Utilities</h2> <p>Once you know the transfer date, call to have utilities put in your name and advise them of the date of transfer, so everything is operational when you move, including:</p> <ul> <li>Water</li> <li>Gas</li> <li>Electricity</li> <li>Sewer</li> <li>Internet</li> <li>Trash services</li> </ul> <p>Some utilities can require a deposit to begin service, so make sure you’re prepared.</p> <h2>17. Change Your Address</h2> <br> <p>As you get closer to your move date, set aside time to change your address with the <a href="https://www.usps.com/" style="color: #0563c1;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>post office</span></a>, as well as directly updating your address with your bank, credit card companies, and streaming services.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let your health care providers know as well, such as doctors, dentists, or veterinarians.</p> <h2>18. Unpack and Enjoy Your New Home</h2> <p>Your hard work has paid off. It's time to unpack and settle in!</p> <p>Be patient with yourself through this process. Getting your furniture and possessions in place takes time. Focus on the immediate necessities — kitchen items, personal care, and clothing — and work on everything else later.</p> <p>Moving into your own place is incredibly rewarding. Knowing how to move out of your parents’ house and planning ahead of time will be satisfying and ensure you’re moving into a home that works for your lifestyle and budget.</p> <p>Just remember you’re not in this alone.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h2>What is the $15,000 First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit?</h2> <a id="whatIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p><strong>The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit is the First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021</strong> and it offers a $15,000 tax credit to first-time homebuyers that meet specific requirements.&nbsp;<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <!--more--> <p>The bill introduces wealth-building opportunities for historically marginalized communities and fulfills one of President Biden's key campaign promises - to make homeownership more accessible to the millions of renters who seek it for themselves and their families.</p> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 737px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.31%; margin: 0px;"><iframe width="737" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rORx7tfT4o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>According to the bill, home buyers who meet the following criteria receive the credit:<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Must be a first-time home buyer</li> <li aria-level="1">Must not have not owned a home in the last 36 months</li> <li aria-level="1">Must not exceed income limitations for the area</li> <li aria-level="1">Must be purchasing a primary residence - no second homes or rental properties</li> <li aria-level="1">Must be at least 18 years of age, or married to a person who is 18 years of age</li> <li aria-level="1">Must be purchasing the home from a non-relative</li> </ul> <p><a href="#eligibility" rel="noopener">More on eligibility below.</a></p> <h2>How Does the First-Time Homebuyer Act Work?</h2> <a id="howDoes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2863/text?r=43&amp;s=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First-Time Homebuyer Act</a> or $15,000 First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit of 2021 is not a loan to be repaid, and it's not a cash grant like the <a href="/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant" rel="noopener">Downpayment Toward Equity Act</a>.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>The tax credit is equal to 10% of your home's purchase price and may not exceed $15,000 in 2021 inflation-adjusted dollars.</p> <p>Assuming a 2 percent inflation rate, the maximum first-time home buyer tax credit would increase as follows over the next five years:<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">2021: Maximum tax credit of $15,000</li> <li aria-level="1">2022: Maximum tax credit of $15,300</li> <li aria-level="1">2023: Maximum tax credit of $15,606</li> <li aria-level="1">2024: Maximum tax credit of $15,918</li> <li aria-level="1">2025: Maximum tax credit of $16,236</li> </ul> <p>When you receive a tax credit, it's applied to your federal tax bill, or refund, directly.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>Married households who file their taxes separately may claim half of the available credit, non-married buyers may claim their proportional share of the credit. At no time may the first-time home buyer tax credit exceed the maximum allowable amount by law.</p> <h3>When Can You Receive the $15,000 Tax Credit</h3> <p>As of {{ datetimeformat(content.publish_date_local_time, '%B %e, %Y') }}, the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit is still a bill and has <span style="font-weight: bold;">not yet been passed into law</span>.</p> <p>If passed into law, eligible first-time home buyers would automatically receive their tax credit, with no action needed beyond the filing of a tax form. And, for homeowners whose tax bill is less than $15,000, the extra amount would be paid via direct deposit.</p> <p>The program applies to all homes purchased beginning January 1, 2021. There is no end date specified, and the $15,000 tax credit could become permanent.</p> <a id="eligibility" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Who Is Eligible For The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit of 2021?</h2> <a id="whoIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>As of today, eligible home buyers who meet all of the following requirements would receive the tax credit from the First-Time Homebuyer Act:</p> <h3>Must be a first-time home buyer</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers may not have owned a home or been a co-signer on a mortgage loan within the last thirty-six months. This includes primary residences, second homes, and vacation rentals.</p> <h3>Must be using the first-time buyer tax credit for the first time</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers may use the tax credit only once. If you use the tax credit to buy a home in 2021, for example, you may not use it again 2026.</p> <h3>Must earn a modest income based on location and household size</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers must earn an income that's no more than 60 percent above the median income for the area. For example, in Columbus, Ohio where the median income is $60,000, home buyers who file their taxes as a single-earner may not have a household income of more than $96,000 per year.</p> <p>Higher income levels are permitted for households with multiple income earners, including married and non-married joint-filers.</p> <h3>Must be 18 years of age or older</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers must be 18 years of age on the date of purchase, or married to a person who is 18 years of age. This rule prevents adults from buying a home with cash in the name of a child, then claiming the tax credit on the child's income tax returns.</p> <h3>Must be purchasing the home from a non-relative</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers may not purchase their home from a relative, including a spouse, parent, child, aunt, uncle, cousin, or grandparent. Note that the bill provides no specific guidance regarding the purchase of a home from an entity controlled by a relative, such as a trust.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p><strong>Important: The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit of 2021 is still a bill, and the above terms of a bill can change by the time they become a law.</strong></p> <h2>How to Receive Your $15,000 Tax Credit</h2> <a id="howTo" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>The First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 text does not specify how to claim your tax credit.</p> <p>However, the bill's language is similar to another first-time buyer tax credit program - the First-Time Homebuyer Credit of 2009. That program required an additional IRS form to accompany the federal tax filing, and it's expected that the 2021 version of the tax credit will do the same.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>However, there's one notable difference: the First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 is retroactive to December 31, 2020, which means that home buyers can file an amended return for the prior year's filing at any time, and receive an immediate cash payout from the U.S. Treasury.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>Consult your tax accountant for details.</p> <h2>If You Move Within 4 Years, You'll Have To Pay Some Money Back</h2> <a id="ifYou" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>The First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 is designed for low- and middle-income households, and meant to build long-term wealth through real estate. It isn't geared toward house-flippers or real estate investors.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>Therefore, buyers who use the home buyer tax credit and change their primary residence or sell within four years of purchase will realize a tax liability based on how long they held their home.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 1: Repay 100% in taxes / $15,000</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 2: Repay 75% in taxes / $11,250</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 3: Repay 50% in taxes / $7,500</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 4: Repay 25% in taxes / $3,750</li> </ul> <p>There are exceptions to the repayment rule.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>One exception states that home buyers who sell their home within four years to a non-relative, and whose real estate gains are less than their tax liability, must only pay their real estate gains.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>For example, if you received a $15,000 credit when you bought your home, and sold your home to somebody related to you in the first 12 months, and made five thousand dollars on the sale of your home, your tax repayment amount would be $5,000.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>There are other exceptions, too, including exceptions for death, divorce, and certain military transfers.</p> <h2>What Does the Downpayment Toward Equity Act Do?</h2> <a id="whatDoes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit is different from another housing-related bill, the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant"><span>Downpayment Toward Equity Act,</span></a> which was also introduced this year. The Downpayment Toward Equity Act proposes to pay $25,000 cash to eligible home buyers to offset closing costs, taxes, and interest.<span style="color: #61657d; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 300;"></span></p> <p>Together, the two bills create a forty-thousand dollar incentive for renters who want to buy their first home.</p> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions From Homebuyer Customers About The $15,000 First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit and First-Time Homebuyer Act</h2> <a id="frequentlyAsked" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>If you have a question and it doesn't appear here, use the chat box and we'll answer you live. We'll then add your question to this FAQ because if you're asking a question, we know that&nbsp; other readers have the same question, too.</p> <h3>Is this program the same as the Biden First-Time Homebuyer Act?</h3> <p>Yes, the First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 is known by several names, including the Biden First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit, the Biden Homebuyer Credit, and the $15,000 Homebuyer Tax Credit. They're all the same thing.</p> <h3>Is the $15,000 Home Buyer Tax Credit available yet?</h3> <p>No, the $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit is unavailable as of today. The program is currently a congressional bill. It may pass into law within a few weeks, a few months, or possibly never. We expect the bill to pass into law in some form before the end of the year. Homebuyer publishes a special newsletter on the topic. Register below.</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hello">Register for our program emails here</a>.</p> <h3>How do I apply for the $15,000 Home Buyer Grant?</h3> <p>Eligible first-time home buyers aren't required to apply for the $15,000 first-time home buyer tax credit - the credit is earned automatically. If you meet the program's eligibility requirements, the IRS will credit your tax bill for the amount you've earned.</p> <h3>If I have to move for work during the first four years, do I have to repay the $15,000 tax credit?</h3> <p>Yes, if you move or sell your home within four years using the program, you're required to pay back at least some of your tax credit. There are exceptions for death, and military transfers.</p> <h3>If I'm a first-time home buyer but my fiancee is not a first-time home buyer, can we claim the $15,000 first-time home buyer tax credit ?</h3> <p>Yes, you can claim the first-time home buyer tax credit if you purchase a home with a non-relative and only one of you is a first-time buyer. In this example, the credit would be reduced by 50% and the first-time home buyer could claim $7,500 on its tax returns.</p> <h3>When I buy a home and use the $15,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, what is the official date of the credit - on the day I sign the contract for the home or on the day of closing?</h3> <p>When you buy a home and claim the $15,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, the tax credit's effective date is the date of closing.</p> <h3>Is the $15,000 first-time home buyer tax credit available for trailer homes, mobile homes, and manufactured homes?</h3> <p>The first-time buyer program can be applied to any home that's zoned for residential property. This includes trailer homes, mobile homes, and manufactured homes.</p> <h3>Is the $15,000 First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 the same thing as the $25,000 program I've heard about?</h3> <p>No, the $15,000 First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 is different from the $25,000 program. The $25,000 program for first-time home buyers is the <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/25000-first-time-home-buyer-downpayment-grant">Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021</a>. Home buyers can potentially qualify for both programs and collect $40,000.</p> <h3>How do I know if my income is too high for the First-Time Homebuyer Act?</h3> <p><a href="https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/lapi1120_1.pdf">Use this chart</a> to find the median income for an area, then multiply that number by 1.6. If your household income is less than or equal to the product, your income is eligible.</p> <h3>Is this program the same as the Biden First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit?</h3> <p>Yes, the First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021 is known by several names, including the Biden First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit, the Biden Homebuyer Credit, and the $15,000 Homebuyer Tax Credit. They're all the same thing.</p> <h3>Can I use the First-Time Homebuyer Act to buy a multi-unit home, and rent out the other units?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use your first-time home buyer tax credit to purchase a 2-unit, 3-unit, or 4-unit home so long as one of the units is your primary residence.</p> <p>{{cta('0d860a55-feb6-4352-9199-544349a15c5b')}}</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_date><![CDATA[June 9, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re moving out of state for a new job, to be near family or just a change of pace, it can be a challenge — especially if you’re buying a house in the process.</p> <!--more--> <p>Fortunately, many things can help. Here’s how to buy a house out of state with ease:</p> <h2>1. Assess Your Moving Situation</h2> <p>The first step toward moving out of state is to assess your situation. What’s your timeframe, and what resources are you working with? For example, if you’re moving for a new job, your employer may offer reimbursement for certain moving expenses. In some cases, they may even help you arrange for movers or other services.</p> <p>You will also need a good handle on the “why” behind your move. This will help you zero in on the best community and home for your needs.</p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 1rem; padding: 25px 53px;">40% of Americans <strong>moved for a new job</strong> in 2020.<br>Source: United Van Lines</p> <h3>Why do you want to move to a new state?</h3> <p>The majority of Americans move out of state due to a job change. According to <a href="https://www.unitedvanlines.com/newsroom/movers-study-2020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>data from United Van Lines</span></a>, a whopping 40% of movers packed up for a new job last year, while about a quarter moved to be close to family.</p> <p>Other reasons you might consider moving out of state include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">To start a family</li> <li aria-level="1">To enjoy an area’s specific culture or values</li> <li aria-level="1">To explore a hobby or interest</li> <li aria-level="1">For a change of climate/weather</li> <li aria-level="1">For better home prices or housing availability</li> </ul> <p>Whatever the reason, use it to help guide your move and focus on the perfect community for your home purchase.</p> <h3>When do you want to move?</h3> <p>Determine your timetable next. According to <a href="https://www.getbellhops.com/blog/" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Bellhops</span></a>, 90% of people move within a month of deciding to do so. Do you want to act that quickly, or do you prefer a leisurely move? Discuss it with your family and start to build a timetable.</p> <p>Keep in mind that buying a house can take a few weeks or a few months. More extended time frames can exist if the area you choose is in high demand. Your move will also depend on whether you want your home to <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home" style="color: #0000ff;"><span>be move-in ready</span></a>, as well as your preferred mortgage lender. Some mortgage lenders can take longer than others to process and close a loan.</p> <h2>2. Research Your New Home State</h2> <p>Now it’s time for some research. You’ll want to dig in and learn all you can about your new state and community before starting your house hunt. Great places to start are the city’s chamber of commerce website, the local newspaper, neighborhood forums, and Facebook groups. Here are some of the <a href="/learn/cheapest-state-to-buy-a-house" rel="noopener">cheapest states to buy a house</a>.</p> <p class="callout" style="font-size: 1rem; padding: 25px 53px;">Satisfaction with your <strong>personal safety, family relationships, and current city</strong> may be top <strong>factors in feeling settled</strong> in your life.<br>Source: <a href="https://porch.com/resource/movers-remorse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Porch</a></p> <p>Here are a few things you’ll want to learn about your new community:</p> <h3>Job prospects and opportunities</h3> <p style="font-weight: normal;">Unless you’ve already secured employment, you should study up on your new city’s job market early on. How in-demand is your career or specialty in the area? What about that of your spouse or partner?</p> <p style="font-weight: normal;">Visit job sites like Monster.com and Indeed.com to see opportunities in the area and what companies are based there. If you’re on LinkedIn, connect with a few business leaders in your new town. They can connect you with potential job opportunities as they arise.</p> <h3>Cost of living</h3> <p style="font-weight: normal;">Knowing the cost of living in your new community will be critical to securing a home within your budget. Move.org has a great list of average prices for many U.S. cities, and Best Places has a calculator you can use to compare your new town against the old one.&nbsp;</p> <p style="font-weight: normal;">For specific data on salaries in the area, use Glassdoor to research local companies. You can also use this data when negotiating your future earnings.</p> <p style="font-weight: normal;">Finally, start researching housing in the area. You’ll want a good idea of what homes cost in the city and what sort of mortgage payment you can expect. Your mortgage lender can give you an accurate payment estimate for your target purchase price.</p> <h3>Attractions and culture</h3> <p>It would help if you also studied up on your new community’s culture, what people do for fun, available amenities for kids, families, or couples, and what hobbies you can explore.</p> <p>Research things like:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Events and festivals</li> <li aria-level="1">Museums</li> <li aria-level="1">Parks and playgrounds</li> <li aria-level="1">Nightlife</li> <li aria-level="1">Recreational centers and facilities</li> <li aria-level="1">Sports teams&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>If possible, consider planning a day or weekend trip to your future community to experience some of these things yourself. This will help you better evaluate if the area meets your needs.</p> <h2>3. Plan to Move to a New State</h2> <p>Now, it’s time to start planning. You’ll need to work out your budget, break down your housing must-haves, and focus on a specific neighborhood for your home search.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Know what’s affordable</h3> <p>There are a lot of costs that go into moving — not to mention buying a house. Take some time to break it all down to make sure you have enough saved up.</p> <p>Take into account:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The cost of movers, vans, boxes, and packing materials</li> <li aria-level="1">Travel to and from your new city before you buy and during the move</li> <li aria-level="1">The down payment and closing costs on your house</li> <li aria-level="1">Any décor or furniture your new home will need</li> <li aria-level="1">Any relocation assistance or reimbursement your employer might offer you</li> </ul> <p>From there, you’ll get an idea of the total costs that buying a house in a different state will come with. Try to leave some cash in savings, too. You never know when it will come in handy.</p> <h3>List your home preferences</h3> <p>Start thinking about what you want in a home. Keep in mind your reasons for moving and use that to help determine your must-haves and nice-to-haves.</p> <p>Have a good idea of:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">The size and number of bedrooms and bathrooms you’d like</li> <li aria-level="1">Any lot/yard requirements</li> <li aria-level="1">The style of home you prefer</li> <li aria-level="1">Whether you want a one- or two-story home</li> <li aria-level="1">Other features you might want, like a garage, patio, pool, or fireplace</li> </ul> <p>Don’t forget to think of your future selves when making this list. What will you want or need five years from now? If you’re planning to have children or adopt a pet down the road, make sure to consider their future needs as well.</p> <h3>Imagine your ideal neighborhood</h3> <p>You’ll also need to locate the best neighborhood for you within your new city — one that offers the types of housing you like, as well as all the amenities, features, and access to your needs.</p> <p>Think about things like:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Access to parks and green spaces</li> <li aria-level="1">Roads, accessibility, and commute times to work&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Local school ratings and programs</li> <li aria-level="1">Walkability</li> <li aria-level="1">Neighborhood amenities like pools, shops, and dog parks (here’s more about buying in a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/home-buying-guide-pet-parents" style="color: #0000ff;"><span>pet-friendly neighborhood</span></a>)&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">HOA rules and local zoning laws</li> <li aria-level="1">Crime rates</li> </ul> <p>Once you’ve narrowed it down to a few neighborhoods, hop on Google Street View and walk the area yourself. This will give you an idea of what the community looks like and how it measures up to your research.</p> <h2>4. Buy a House In Another State</h2> <p>Buying a house out of state before you move can seem daunting. Fortunately, technology makes most of the necessary steps stress-free and allows you to buy a home in another state with ease.</p> <h3>Visit the city in person</h3> <p>If possible, visit your new city in person. This will help you better assess the neighborhoods, culture, and amenities your new town comes with.</p> <p>While you’re there, go on a few home tours — even if you’re not ready to buy yet. It will give you a good idea of home styles in the area, and it might even help you hone your must-haves list a little more.</p> <h3>Secure financing</h3> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>Getting pre-approved</span></a> for your mortgage is an essential first step in the house-hunting process. Pre-approvals give you an idea of how much you can borrow and ensures that home sellers take your offer seriously.</p> <p>As important as your mortgage pre-approval is, don’t forget your budget. How much you want to afford often differs from the maximum amount you’re pre-approved for. Having an accurate budget and sticking to it will set you up for a long run of happy, stress-free years in your new home.</p> <p>{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d','justifycenter')}}</p> <h3>Choose a local real estate agent</h3> <p>Since you’re buying from afar, you’ll need an on-the-ground agent who can be your eyes and ears for you. Choose one that specializes in your specific city or neighborhood, and make sure they’re tech-savvy. You’ll want video calls while they’re touring properties for you and at other points in the buying process, too.</p> <p>Consider interviewing multiple options and get recommendations from people you know in the area. Your mortgage lender can point you toward a good agent as well.</p> <h3>Learn about local real estate laws</h3> <p>When it comes to real estate, every state (and often city) has different laws. There are rules regarding disclosures, zoning, inspections, deeds, property lines, and more. All of these can impact your purchase.</p> <p>Talk to a real estate attorney in the area to learn what laws and fees your new home purchase may come with. They’ll be able to walk you through the different requirements, as well as any responsibilities you might have along the way. You can also check with your city’s housing or planning department to learn more about local ordinances that could impact your purchase.</p> <h3>Buy your new home</h3> <p>Once you’ve been pre-approved, have studied up on the area, completed your budget, and nailed your must-have list, it’s time to find your dream home.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can use virtual home tours, 3D walkthroughs, and Google Street View to help you assess properties from afar. And don’t forget to lean on your agent for help. Having them do a live video call from your top three or four properties is a great way to see the homes and get live feedback from someone in the house.</p> <p>When you’ve found the home for you, work with your agent to make an offer, negotiate, and finalize the contract. Then it’s time to schedule your inspection and start packing. You’ll also need to make travel arrangements and start lining up movers if you plan to hire help.</p> <h3>Buying a new house out of state doesn’t have to be complicated</h3> <p>There’s no hard-and-fast requirement for purchasing a house in another state, but you should expect to put a reasonable amount of time and research into the process. Fortunately, once all is said and done, you’ll be in your new home — one that’s a better fit for your career, health, wealth, and family.<span style="font-size: 16px; color: #434343;"></span></p> <p>Just remember: you’re not in this alone. Hire a local agent to help guide you, and lean on technology and <a href="/start" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener"><span>home buyer education</span></a> to ease the process.</p> <p>If you’d like advice on how to buy a house out of state, get in touch with Homebuyer today.

Line your walkways for decor and safety and hang string lights on your patio for late-night entertaining.&nbsp;</p> <p>Choose solar lights to skip the electrical wiring and save on utility bills. A set of eight solar landscape lights costs about $50.</p> <h3>10. Native landscaping</h3> <p>Plant flowers and grasses native to your local ecosystem that can thrive with little maintenance. Native plant species also support local wildlife and pollinators, so your yard will look beautiful and benefit the environment.&nbsp;</p> <a id="Window-ideas" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Curb Appeal Upgrades for Your Windows</h2> <p>Windows are vital features in your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/house-styles"><span>home’s architecture.</span></a> A few upgrades can improve your curb appeal and add focus to your home’s design.&nbsp;</p> <h3>11. Flower planters</h3> <p>Flower planters come in many styles so you can find affordable ones that match your home. Make your own planters with glass jars and tins, or purchase affordable planters from thrift stores if you’re on a budget.</p> <p>These are staples for quick curb appeal upgrades and look beautiful year-round with seasonal flowers. Plant ornamental herbs or small vegetables if you prefer greenery over florals.&nbsp;</p> <h3>12. Painted shutters</h3> <p>Shutters are easy to build yourself or buy and install. They can be functional or decorative to best suit your needs. Re-paint your shutters if your home already has them for a sleek finish and updated color palette.&nbsp;</p> <p>Exterior shutters start at $50, or you can make your own with pallets or reclaimed wood.&nbsp;</p> <h3>13. Adorable awnings</h3> <p>Awnings look great and offer the benefit of additional shade. Cloth awnings can protect your interior from the sun’s heat, while wooden pergola awnings can grow plants that add to your garden.&nbsp;</p> <p>Window awnings can cost up to $450, but they can also be <a href="https://www.wcmanet.org/how-to-make-window-awning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>made at home</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <a id="landscaping-ideas" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Landscaping Curb Appeal Ideas</h2> <p>Impressive landscaping can be affordable and easy to maintain when you purchase the right plants for your lifestyle. Start by adding features and work around a focal point, like a fountain or large tree.&nbsp;</p> <h3>14. Ornamental trees</h3> <p>Trees add levels and color to your yard design with little maintenance required. Small trees are straightforward to trim, though you can choose a Juniper tree to sculpt into eye-catching designs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Costs vary depending on the age and kind of tree you buy, and there are plenty of <a href="https://shop.arborday.org/nursery" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Arbor Day deals</span></a> to explore.&nbsp;</p> <h3>15. Gorgeous greenery</h3> <p>Beautiful front yards don’t require meticulously planned flower gardens. Green shrubs, grasses, trees, and ornamental herbs can create a welcoming escape similar to walking into a forest. Occasional watering and trimmings are all these plants need to thrive.&nbsp;</p> <h3>16. Well-kept walkways</h3> <p>Keep your walkways clean and neat by trimming the edges regularly or framing the path with brick or flowers. You can also upgrade your sidewalk with stone or brick. Consider a winding path to add shape and character to your yard design.&nbsp;</p> <h3>17. Floral finish</h3> <p>Flower beds add pops of color and texture to brighten your landscaping. Plant small flower beds around trees and other focal points for a simple polish. Extensive flower beds with flowing edges and shapes provide depth and interest.&nbsp;</p> <p>A beautiful flower bed can be planted for the cost of mulch and your choice of flowers. Affordable flowers start at $5 per live plant, though you can grow your own from seeds to save more.</p> <h3>18. Planter placements</h3> <p>Use planters to arrange plants around your yard without having to dig or mulch the area. You can also bring these plants in as the seasons change to save on buying new plants each year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Planters also let you extend your landscaping onto your porch and around your home.&nbsp;</p> <h3>19. Healthy lawn</h3> <p>A green and lush lawn beautifies every home and doesn’t require much maintenance. Learn what grass you have planted and its care requirements to keep it healthy. Regularly weed and treat your lawn, and place grass seed in any bare spots.&nbsp;</p> <p>DIY lawn maintenance is practically free, and weed killer starts at $20.</p> <a id="diy-creative-ideas" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>DIY Creative Curb Appeal Ideas&nbsp;</h2> <p>Stunning curb appeal is easy to do yourself. Get creative and try these simple upgrades to refresh your home’s curb appeal.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/cool-and-creative-home-garden-ideas.jpg" alt="&quot;Make a living wall and lean into shapes&quot; are two pieces of advice you didn't think you'd hear from a mortgage company but here we are. Just remember that homebuyer.com thinks the world of you." loading="lazy" style="width: 737px;" width="737"></p> <h3>20. Mailbox revamp</h3> <p>Install a new mailbox or paint your current one to match your new home’s curb appeal and upgrades. Customize your mailbox with your street address, family name, or hobbies for a personalized welcome. Don’t forget to decorate with flowers, flags, or fencing around your mailbox for the perfect finishing touch.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many decorative mailboxes are available for $100 or less, or you can repaint your mailbox for about $10.</p> <h3>21. House numbers</h3> <p>Paint house numbers on your curb or mailbox, or hang numbers on your porch to make your home easy to find. You can also build a planter box or another decorative feature to post your address for welcoming guests.&nbsp;</p> <h3>22. Fence finesse</h3> <p>A classic picket fence will always feel like home. Install partial or complete fencing to define your yard and add polish. A small fence is excellent for lining flower beds or defining the edge of your lawn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most decorative garden fencing costs up to $15 per two-foot panel. However, you can choose more affordable or expensive options according to your taste.&nbsp;</p> <a id="Cleaning" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Cleaning for Curb Appeal</h2> <p>Cleaning the outside of your house and lawn is potentially the cheapest and easiest way to improve your curb appeal.&nbsp;</p> <h3>23. Exterior scrub</h3> <p>Power wash to deep clean your home’s exterior and remove mildew or moss. You can also clean your siding with household cleaner, vinegar, water, or Simple Green and a soft-bristled brush. This is the safest choice if your siding manufacturer warns against using a power washer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store for less than $100 a day.&nbsp;</p> <h3>24. Walkway wash</h3> <p>Sidewalks and driveways also accumulate dirt and grime throughout the year. Use a power washer or stiff-bristled brush with a handle to scrub brick and stone clean. Gently clean with a soft-bristled brush if your walkway has tile.</p> <h3>25. Yard cleanup</h3> <p>Clear your yard to showcase its best features. Clean up any fallen leaves or sticks and add them to compost or take them out with your next trash pickup. Be sure to clear weeds and dead or dying plants to keep your lawn healthy.&nbsp;</p> <h3>26. Roof and gutters</h3> <p>Clear leaves and debris out of your gutters and angles on your roof. Check for damage and repair any missing shingles while you have the ladder out. You can soft wash any algae or moss that’s accumulated.&nbsp;</p> <h3>27. Porch and patio</h3> <p>Scrub your porch and patio clean, and don’t forget to remove debris from between the wood boards. Add a sealant if your deck is due for a new coating to protect the wood from the weather. Retouch paint as necessary or repaint the whole patio for a new look.&nbsp;</p> <h3>28. Sparkling windows</h3> <p>Rinse your windows with a hose and scrub the trim for sparkling windows. Wash the outside of your windows and rinse your screens thoroughly to remove dirt and pollen.</p> <a id="easy-ideas" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Bonus Easy Curb Appeal Ideas</h2> <p>Want to boost your curb appeal quickly?

Colonial Style&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/colonial-style-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Image of a Colonial house style."></span></p> <p>Colonial-style houses are simple rectangular homes that became popular in the 1600s as colonists settled the East Coast. These homes have many variations due to the fact that new communities all over the world built Colonial-style homes to suit their culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>British Colonial style is the most common and recognizable Colonial home. Its key features include:<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A side-gabled roof</li> <li aria-level="1">Two floors</li> <li aria-level="1">A centered front door</li> <li aria-level="1">Symmetrical windows on either side of the door</li> </ul> <p>The rectangular shape and interest in symmetry are seen in other Colonial house styles, too. Materials and decorative features can vary by region, as some Colonial houses sport brick exteriors and ornate trim, while others showcase shingle siding and simple shutters.</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">2. Cape Cod Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/cape-cod-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Cape Cod house style." style="color: #080e33; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><span></span></h2> <p><br><a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a24516732/what-is-a-cape-cod-style-house/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Cape Cod</span></a> homes are similar to the British or American Colonial homes, though they originated further north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. These are often seen as the classic American family home since the style’s revival in the 20th Century.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cape Cod homes are identified by their:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Shingle exteriors</li> <li aria-level="1">Modest size and ornamentation compared to British Colonial homes</li> <li aria-level="1">Originally single-story homes</li> <li aria-level="1">Large central fireplaces</li> <li aria-level="1">Attic lofts (20th-century revival)</li> <li aria-level="1">Dormer windows (20th-century revival)</li> </ul> <p>Cape Cod homes are built of local wood and stone to withstand the north-eastern weather. This exterior weathering provides an iconic weathered-blue color to these homes.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">3.&nbsp; Dutch Colonial Revival Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/dutch-revival-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Dutch Colonial Revival house style." style="color: #080e33; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"></h2> <p><br>Most Dutch Colonial homes you find today are actually from the Colonial Revival period of the early 20th Century. Original Dutch Colonial homes feature flared roof eaves and creative wood and brickwork. They are much more ornamental than classic Colonial homes, though the Dutch Colonial Revival style tends to be more subdued than the original Dutch Colonial homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dutch Colonial Revival houses feature:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Broad gambrel roofs that are visually similar to barn-style roofs</li> <li aria-level="1">Open-floor plans</li> <li aria-level="1">Flared roof eaves</li> <li aria-level="1">Split doors</li> </ul> <p>The large barn-style roofs are the most identifiable feature of a Dutch Colonial home and even became known as “Dutch roofs.”</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">4. Federal Colonial Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/federal-colonial-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Federal Colonial house style.

They have the same recurring shape and symmetry as other Colonial house styles, but their delicate ornamentation sets them apart.</p> <p>Federal Colonial homes often feature:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A layout built around a central hall</li> <li aria-level="1">An elliptical fanlight and two flanking lights (windows) around the door</li> <li aria-level="1">Paladin or tripartite windows</li> </ul> <p>The elliptical fanlights and paladin windows are key distinguishing features from Georgian-style homes.</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">5. French Colonial Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/french-colonial-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a French Colonial house style. " style="color: #080e33; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"></h2> <p><br>The <a href="https://architecturesstyle.com/french-colonial-architecture/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>French Colonial house</span></a> style can be seen around the world and has significant variety among its sub-styles.&nbsp;</p> <p>French Colonial houses have the same symmetry as other Colonial homes with these distinct features:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Dormer windows, including one centered above the door</li> <li aria-level="1">External stairs to enter higher floors</li> <li aria-level="1">Iron stairs and balconies</li> <li aria-level="1">Slightly raised basements to support the floor</li> </ul> <p>French Colonial houses are most similar to Spanish Colonial houses and easily identified by their elaborate iron balconies, stairs, and entrances.</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">6. Georgian Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/georgian-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Georgian Colonial house style. "></span></p> <p>Georgian-style homes were <a href="http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/georgian.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>one of the most common styles</span></a> in the 18th century and showcased formal and classical details that previous homes didn’t. Georgian houses are similar to Federal houses, though they can be distinguished by:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A crown and pilasters framing the front door</li> <li aria-level="1">Decorative quoins or bricks at the corners</li> <li aria-level="1">Smooth decorative blocks as moulding</li> </ul> <p>You can also find regional variations with hooded front doors and pent roofs between levels.</p> <h2>7.

Craftsman Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/craftsman-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Craftsman or Arts and Craft house style. "></span></p> <p>There was a renewed interest in handcrafted art and design following the industrial revolution. This became the “Arts and Crafts” era and paved the way for the Craftsman home, or “arts and crafts” home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Craftsman homes focus on simplicity to counter the ornate stylings of Victorian homes. They’re also designed to highlight the craftsmanship of its builders and include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A low-pitched roof with overhanging eaves</li> <li aria-level="1">A covered porch</li> <li aria-level="1">Woodwork including exposed beams and built-in features like shelving</li> <li aria-level="1">Natural tones to complement the warmth from woodworking</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/interior-designers/a27437794/craftsman-style-house/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Craftsman homes</span></a> are favored for their character and are another versatile style that may borrow common elements from other home styles.&nbsp;</p> <h2>10.

These homes celebrate and complement the natural beauty of the Midwestern landscape with low and long shapes in the floor plan and building elements.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prairie-style houses showcase:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Long and low-to-the-ground builds</li> <li aria-level="1">Flat or shallow roofs with overhanging eaves</li> <li aria-level="1">Thin bricks or stucco exteriors to match the house shape</li> <li aria-level="1">Minimalist yet stylized ornamentation</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.architecture.org/learn/resources/architecture-dictionary/entry/prairie-style/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Prairie houses</span></a> inspired the flat planes and natural elements popular in Mid-century houses.</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">17. Pueblo Revival Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/pueblo-revival-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of Pueblo Revival style architecture. "></span></p> <p>The Pueblo Revival was inspired by the indigenous Pueblo people’s architecture in the Southwestern US. Pueblo homes were made of adobe or stucco and designed to handle the extreme temperatures of the desert.&nbsp;</p> <p>Architects in California began to explore the Pueblo style in the late 19th century and the Pueblo Revival style spread across New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href="https://homereference.net/pueblo-revival/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Pueblo Revival</span></a> hit its peak in the 1930s in Santa Fe, and these Pueblo-style elements are still popular in the Southwest:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Rounded corners and irregular shapes</li> <li aria-level="1">Earth tones that reflect the desert colors</li> <li aria-level="1">Stepped effects with higher floors becoming smaller</li> <li aria-level="1">Flat roofs with parapet trim</li> <li aria-level="1">Exposed roof beams extending past the walls</li> </ul> <p>The Pueblo Revival style is also commonly called Adobe or Santa Fe style architecture.</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">18. Ranch Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/ranch-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Ranch house. "></span></p> <p><a href="https://www.khov.com/blog/what-is-a-ranch-style-house/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Ranch house</span></a> styles are the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/get-your-hands-dirty-summer-these-home-and-garden-trends/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>most searched style</span></a> in the US today and are common in cities and suburbs across the country. There are various ranch house styles, including California and split-level ranch homes. The main distinguishing features between these styles are living space and home layout.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ranch style homes feature:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Single-story floor plans with low-pitched roofs</li> <li aria-level="1">Rectangular, “U,” or “L” shaped open floor plans</li> <li aria-level="1">Patio or deck space connected to the home</li> <li aria-level="1">Often includes a finished basement or attached garage</li> </ul> <p>Ranch homes are the <a href="https://www.trulia.com/blog/guide-to-most-popular-home-styles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>most popular homes in 34 US states</span></a> — particularly in the Midwest and on the East Coast.</p> <h2>19. Townhouse Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/townhome-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a row of townhouses.

Townhouses are tall and narrow homes designed to make the most out of vertical space without too much of a yard or garden area.&nbsp;</p> <p>Homes are considered townhouses when they:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Share one or two walls with adjacent homes&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Have their own entrances</li> <li aria-level="1">Are built with multiple floors to maximize vertical space</li> <li aria-level="1">Often share a similar style to their neighbors’ homes and may operate under an HOA</li> </ul> <p>Townhouses can be built to mimic other architecture styles, like Italianate and Greek Revival, while maintaining the condensed, vertical floor plan.</p> <h2>20. Tudor Revival Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/tudor-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Tudor style home."><br><br></span><a href="https://simplynorthshore.com/6-characteristics-of-tudor-architecture/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Modern Tudor</span></a> homes are inspired by Medieval European Tudor homes and often have a charming cottage aesthetic. They’re popular on the East Coast and in parts of the Midwest.</p> <p>Tudor homes are an easy style to identify. They feature:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Steeply pitched gable roofs</li> <li aria-level="1">Exposed and decorative half-timbering with stucco exterior</li> <li aria-level="1">Mixed-material brick or stone walls</li> <li aria-level="1">Casement windows in groups or with diamond shapes</li> </ul> <p>The <a href="https://architecturestyles.org/tudor-revival/#:~:text=HISTORICAL%20BACKGROUND%20AND%20FEATURES%3A%20Tudor,buildings%20popular%20at%20that%20time." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Tudor Revival</span></a> reached peak popularity in the 1920s and is still widely popular today.&nbsp;</p> <h2>21. Victorian Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/victorian-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Victorian style home. "><br><br></span><a href="https://www.oldhouses.com/styleguide/victorians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Victorian homes</span></a> were built between 1837 and 1901 while Queen Victoria reigned in Britain. “Victorian” actually refers to multiple styles that vary in influence, but each features ornate detailing and asymmetrical floor plans.&nbsp;</p> <p>The key features of a Victorian-era home include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Elaborate woodwork and trim</li> <li aria-level="1">Towers, turrets, and dormer windows</li> <li aria-level="1">Steep gabled roofs</li> <li aria-level="1">Partial or full-width porches</li> </ul> <p>Victorian homes are all about ornamentation — industrialization allowed these homes to be produced en masse and across a variety of architectural styles.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">22. Gothic Revival Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/goth-revival-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Gothic Revival house style. "></span></p> <p><a href="http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/gothic-revival.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Gothic Revival</span></a> architecture grew in the mid-19th century and was one of the early styles of Victorian-era homes. The Gothic Revival style takes influence from Medieval Europe and was designed as a country home. Architects believed the asymmetrical design and ornamentation complemented the nature of rural America.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gothic Revival homes can be identified by their:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Pointed arch in windows, doors, and decoration</li> <li aria-level="1">Elaborate wood trim vergeboards and bargeboards</li> <li aria-level="1">Steeply pitched roofs and front-facing gables</li> <li aria-level="1">Towers and turrets resembling medieval castles</li> </ul> <p>Gothic Revival architecture was a popular style for schools and churches as well as rural homes.</p> <h2>23. Italianate Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/italianate-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of an Italianate house style. " style="color: #080e33; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"></h2> <br> <p>Italianate architecture continues the trend of asymmetrical design, romanticism, and Medieval influence — this time borrowing features from Medieval Italy. <a href="https://savingplaces.org/stories/what-is-italianate-architecture#.YJA-TBNKiCR" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Italianate style</span></a> is common up and down the East Coast and peaked in popularity between 1850 and 1880.</p> <p>Italianate architecture features:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Belvederes for natural light and airflow</li> <li aria-level="1">Overhanging eaves with decorative support brackets</li> <li aria-level="1">Tall and narrow or pedimented windows with rounded crowns</li> <li aria-level="1">Cast iron detailing and decor</li> </ul> <p>Pattern books were becoming a popular way for craftsmen to build homes in different styles. This flexibility meant Italianate features were accessible for a variety of homes including large estates and urban townhouses.</p> <h2>24. Queen Anne Style<img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/queen-anne-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Queen Anne Victorian style house. " style="color: #080e33; font-family: circular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"></h2> <p><br><a href="http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/queen-anne.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Queen Anne</span></a> homes were popularized in the later Victorian era, beginning around 1880. This style is the quintessential Victorian home for many, with ornate woodworking and decor inside and out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Queen Anne homes have key regional differences across the country, but maintain these essentials:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Textured walls with decorative shingles or half-timbering</li> <li aria-level="1">Large round or polygonal tower at the home’s corner</li> <li aria-level="1">Steeply pitched and asymmetrical roof</li> <li aria-level="1">Decorative spindles on porches and trim</li> <li aria-level="1">Decorative single-pane or stained glass windows</li> </ul> <p>Queen Anne architecture is most common in homes, but can also be seen in schools, churches, and office buildings.&nbsp;</p> <h2>25. Second Empire</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/second-empire-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Second Empire house style. "></span></p> <p>Second Empire homes were a modern Victorian-era style that started in France before spreading through the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. Second Empire architecture features similar ornate Victorian trends, though generally offers a simplified Victorian aesthetic.</p> <p>These elements help identify a Second Empire home:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Uniquely shaped <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/mansard-roof" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Mansard Roof</span></a></li> <li aria-level="1">Decorative window framing and dormers</li> <li aria-level="1">Decorative rails or balustrades around terraces and staircases</li> <li aria-level="1">Iron roof crest and eaves with support brackets</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/architecture/styles/second-empire.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Second Empire homes</span></a> are also easy to identify since they’re the only Victorian-era style that often features a symmetrical, rectangular floor plan.&nbsp;</p> <h2>26.&nbsp; Shingle Style</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #434343;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/shingle-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a Shingle Style home. "><br><br></span>Shingle-style homes took influence from Colonial architecture rather than Medieval Europe. Ornamentation became simpler towards the end of the Victorian-era and Shingle-style homes are best known for their creative floor plans and signature shingles on exterior walls.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shingle Victorian homes are identified by these interior and exterior features:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Shingles cover the entire exterior</li> <li aria-level="1">Asymmetrical interior layouts without a central hallway</li> <li aria-level="1">Emphasis on horizontal planes</li> <li aria-level="1">Custom built to meld with the nature surrounding the house</li> </ul> <p>Shingle-style houses were designed as a work of art and encouraged creativity in their use of shapes and features.&nbsp;</p> <p>House styles will continue to evolve with influences from history, culture, and our lifestyles. All of these house styles can be seen and celebrated across the US and have their own stories to tell. Choose the house style that fits your lifestyle, location, and, of course, personal style best. Then check your <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-buy-a-house"><span>credit score</span></a>, get pre-approved, and start house-hunting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy homebuying!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;">{{cta('e8ce89ac-1707-478c-a157-4c0d88d5e03d')}}</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Several factors can impact your decision to buy a new home. Homeownership is a wealth-building opportunity, and a new home can make room for a growing family. For pet parents, the decision to buy a house may be to accommodate their furry friend and their needs.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-animal-house-pets-in-the-home-buying-and-selling-process-04-23-2020.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span>43% of homeowners</span></a> are willing to move to find a better home for their pets. Dog ownership has <a href="https://bestfriends.org/no-kill-2025/animal-welfare-statistics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>grown by 39%</span></a> over the last 10 years. Home buyers with pets feel a responsibility to look out for their best friend’s interests. This is why 68% of REALTOR® clients choose their new home with pets in mind.</p> <p>This guide highlights <a href="#infographic" rel="noopener">what to consider as a pet parent</a> so you can <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>get pre-approved</span></a> and house hunt confidently.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Questions to Ask Yourself When Checking Out a Neighborhood</h2> <p>The area you move to may be as important for your pet’s well-being as the home you choose. Keep these questions in mind as you search for your neighborhood so you can make the best choice for yourself and your pet.</p> <h3><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/what-makes-a-pet-friendly-yard%20(2).png" alt="What are the key features of a pet-friendly yard? Well, you should have room to play and a proper fence, but you should also have an awesome doggo (or cat or rabbit or whatever). " loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></h3> <h3>Is the neighborhood pet-friendly?</h3> <p>The basics of a pet-friendly neighborhood include sidewalks, nearby parks, and shade to keep cool in the summer. These features make planning daily walks easy knowing that you’re safe from <span style="color: #33475b; background-color: #ffffff;">passing vehicles</span>&nbsp;and inclement weather.</p> <p>Walk the neighborhood a few times to watch for off-leash and stray pets so you know what to expect on your walks. This is especially important if you allow traditionally indoor pets like cats and rabbits outside.&nbsp;</p> <p>See what plants are growing in the area, especially near sidewalks where your pet can eat them. If your dog responds well to “leave it,” this may not be a problem. Stay vigilant if your dog is known to eat leaves or stray “snacks” on the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>Similarly, there may be new wildlife to be aware of. Learn what kinds of wild animals live in the area and take proactive safety measures, like snake aversion training.</p> <p>Small outdoor animals, like chickens and rabbits, should have an enclosure to protect against potential predators in the area.</p> <p>Remember: most environments are pet-friendly when you identify concerns and train for safety first.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Are there any HOA or local pet laws to know?</h3> <p>Many cities and neighborhoods have specific laws for pets, particularly dogs, and each community may have its own guidelines. Look into local breed restrictions before you move.</p> <p>HOAs may also have rules about the number of pets in your home, the size of your pets, and spay or neuter guidelines.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider your dog’s behavior when reading local laws, too. Talkative dogs may be better suited in a home with a large yard rather than a neighborhood with homes built close together. Dogs that play rough outside may also make it difficult to keep up with guidelines for yard appearances.</p> <p>City and HOA rules also affect what structures you can put in your yard. These rules may limit the types of fences you can install and may limit the construction of other structures, such as an outdoor cat patio.</p> <p>Read your local laws and neighborhood rules before buying to make sure your home and neighborhood accommodate your family.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How close are your vet and the nearest animal hospital?</h3> <p>Depending on how far you’re moving, you may have to find a new veterinarian. Ask your vet for recommendations if you choose to switch offices.&nbsp;</p> <p>Regardless of the vet you choose, you should identify an emergency veterinarian nearby in case of an accident. Young and senior pets may be especially prone to emergencies.</p> <h2>Features of a Pet-Friendly Home</h2> <p>After you’re sure the neighborhood works, here are some features to consider in your future home.</p> <h3><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/safe-home-features-for-your-pets%20(2).png" alt="Illustration of a woman and her cat list 4 safe home features for your pet." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></h3> <h3>1. Durable and pet-appropriate flooring</h3> <p>As a homeowner, you get to choose your home’s flooring.</p> <p>If you prefer carpet, purchase appropriate cleaning supplies to remove dirt and dander. Carpet care with pets may require:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">A vacuum designed with pets in mind&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Pre-treatment sprays for any accidents&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">A plan to shampoo carpets each season</li> </ul> <p>If you prefer hardwood floors, consider large rugs and runners to minimize damage.</p> <p>Also, scratch-resistant floors are popular because they limit the damage of rough play and claws. Textured floors also help pets avoid slipping, especially if they’re getting older.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.flooringinc.com/blog/best-flooring-for-dogs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Flooring experts</span></a> recommend these floorings for pets:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Vinyl&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level="1">Tile</li> <li aria-level="1">Laminate</li> <li aria-level="1">Cork</li> <li aria-level="1">Bamboo&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Choose the flooring that fits your lifestyle and tastes best. Add carpet runners and rugs for extra comfort and traction.</p> <h3>2. Space to play inside</h3> <p>Give your pet space to play inside. Cageless pets should have a designated space where you keep their bed, toys, crate, and food and water. This gives them space to rest on their own and can keep your home organized.</p> <p>Indoor-only pets should also have a pet-proof space to run and play safely. Make use of vertical space with cat trees or floating ledges that your cat can enjoy without tripping over your family and furniture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Small pets have specific space needs, too. Small mammals like rabbits should have at least <a href="http://www.therabbithouse.com/guide_size.asp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>12 square feet</span></a> of space in their cages to play. They also need supervised play outside of their cages each day. Be sure to protect wires, furniture legs, and baseboards that may otherwise become chew toys.&nbsp;</p> <h3>3. Flexible layout and design</h3> <p>Consider your pet’s age and breed when deciding if a multi-level home is right for you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Small dogs and those with long spines, such as Dachshunds and Corgis, may need extra help to climb stairs safely. Larger breeds that are prone to joint complications, including German Shepherds and Labradors, may also need help as they age.&nbsp;</p> <p>If your home has a spacious first floor, you can gate the stairs so your pet can’t access them. You may also install automatic night lights and a stair runner carpet to help them climb more safely</p> <p>Consider what other spaces you want to be pet-free. For example, a kitchen doorway that’s easy to gate will thwart a food-motivated pet who’s always looking for treats.</p> <h3>4. Appropriate yard size and location</h3> <p>Yards are a great way for your pet to get daily exercise. A big yard may be ideal for active breeds, like Australian Shepherds and Huskies, while a small yard would work for most toy breeds and smaller pets like guinea pigs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider a fence for your furry family. Most dogs are safe behind a five-foot fence. If your dog is a jumper, though, opt for a six-foot fence or install a coyote roller to keep your pet in and other pets out.</p> <p>Consider what type of fence works best for your family, too. Chain link and split rail fences can be great for friendly neighbor dogs to greet each other, but a privacy fence can help your dog relax outside without distractions.&nbsp;</p> <p>The location and environment of your yard also affect your pet. If you live near a creek or heavily wooded area, fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes may be frequent visitors so you’ll have to treat your pet and yard appropriately.&nbsp;</p> <p>Take a tour of your yard before you move in to make your home <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-move-in-ready-home"><span>move-in ready</span></a> and safe for your furry family.&nbsp;</p> <h3>5. Space for baths and clean up</h3> <p>Pets need baths and your new home should have room to clean your pets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Large pets will fare best in a bathtub, and small pets can be sometimes bathed in a sink.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plan for rainy days, too. A mudroom or patio can limit the amount of mud and dirt that enter your home; and paw plungers, towels, and wipes can remove dirt and pollen from fur.&nbsp;</p> <p>Regular baths keep your pet and home healthy and clean.</p> <h2>How to Introduce Your Pets to Their New Home</h2> <p>Start slow and follow your pet’s lead to keep them comfortable. Know your pet’s behaviors and try some of these tips to help your pet adjust to their new home.</p> <h3><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/man-and-woman-cuddling-cat-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Man and woman cuddling with their cat."></h3> <h3>Walk the neighborhood</h3> <p>Plan a trip to walk the new neighborhood with your dog before you move so the location isn’t totally new to them. Let your dog sniff all of the new scents and explore local areas like parks and walking trails on a few trips.&nbsp;</p> <p>This also gives you a chance to meet your neighbors and see how your dog interacts with neighborhood pets. You’ll both better understand the area and will feel more comfortable in a familiar space.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Plan to play before move-in day</h3> <p>Finish the majority of your move before you bring your pet home. Moving and unpacking can be stressful for them and poses an escape risk as you’re constantly going in and out of the home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Spend plenty of time playing and exercising before you move your pet in. This allows them to relieve extra energy and remain calm in a new situation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prepare enrichment activities like treat-stuffed toys, snuffle mats, and scent games to keep your dog engaged. Puzzle games let your pet direct extra energy into a mental challenge instead of eating your new moulding.&nbsp;</p> <p>Puzzle feeders and toys are great for all pets, not just dogs. Small mammals like rabbits and rats can enjoy freeing treats from cardboard tubes and boxes. Cats enjoy treat-dispensing balls they can hunt and play with.</p> <p>Once everything begins to settle, give your pet dedicated attention and playtime. This helps them feel secure in a new space.</p> <h3>Take introductions slowly and stick to a schedule</h3> <p>Start slow and introduce your pet to their new home on a leash or limit their exposure to a single room. This allows them to get used to new smells and surroundings without being overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Keep your pet in a crate or restricted space if you have to leave for extended periods of time to prevent accidents.</p> <p>Different pets have different needs, so follow their lead for what’s comfortable. Some pets may be eager to explore while others are hesitant. Take it slow and keep pet items and schedules familiar.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just like us, pets have a daily routine they follow and it’s important to stick to that schedule. Feedings, walks, and play times should all stay similar to provide a sense of normalcy and comfort.</p> <h3>Reward calm and collected behavior</h3> <p>It’s common for your pet to pick up new behaviors when they’re presented with big changes. Reward good behavior to prevent unwanted habits from developing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reward your pet with treats or toys when they’re relaxed and behaving how you’d like them to. Providing praise when they greet nicely or play well can also prevent habits like unnecessary barking from developing.</p> <p>Practicing basic obedience lessons before the move can help prevent new behaviors from developing, too. This way, you’re reinforcing what your pet has been practicing in a new space. Daily training also helps you and your pet bond, which is great when entering a new experience together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h3>Delay doggy playdates</h3> <p>While you may be eager to meet the new neighbors, give your pet some time to adjust before planning any doggy playdates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once your dog builds confidence walking the neighborhood and seeing other pets from a distance, you can schedule walks together and begin making new friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>If your next-door neighbors have dogs, be proactive and introduce yourself before you move. Ask about their dog’s behavior and exchange contact information. This way, you can prevent any stressful situations or schedule a time to properly introduce your pets.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Take extra precautions for a safe move</h3> <p>Take proper precautions to prevent any accidents since pets can behave unexpectedly in a new home. So, if you are <a href="/learn/how-to-move-out-of-your-parents-house" rel="noopener">moving out of your parent's house</a> where your pet has become very comfortable, it might take them some time to readjust to new surroundings.</p> <p>Move and unpack as much as you can before moving your pet in, and be sure to keep them in a crate or carrier while you’re moving.</p> <p>Don’t rely on your pet’s recall ability until they’re fully acclimated to their new home. Keep dogs leashed and under your control for the first few weeks until you both feel confident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Moving to a new home has huge benefits for you and your pet. Prioritize their safety and be proactive in making sure the neighborhood and home are a good fit for your family.&nbsp;</p> <a id="infographic" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>Happy homebuying!</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/the-homebuying-guide-for-pet-parents-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Infographic shares tips to buying a pet-friendly home for your furry family.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>You may encounter several new <a href="/learn/home-buying-terminology" rel="noopener">home buying words</a> and phrases when you begin house-hunting, such as “move-in ready” and “fixer-upper.” Although they’re straightforward terms, they’re nuanced.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>Technically speaking, what is a move-in ready home? Move-in ready homes meet all local municipal codes and require no major renovations to be considered liveable. This means that the homes are structurally sound and safe.</p> <p>Move-in ready homes are sometimes called turnkey homes and, although there exists a legal definition for <a href="https://thelawdictionary.org/move-in-ready/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>move-in ready home</span></a>, every home buyer thinks of “move-in ready” differently.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you know exactly what you’re looking for, you can look for it online. We’ve broken down what to expect with move-in ready homes and made a <a href="#flowchart" rel="noopener">flowchart</a> to help you decide what kind of home is right for you.&nbsp;</p> <h2>What Is a Move-In Ready Home?</h2> <p class="callout">Move-in ready homes are structurally sound and meet all local code requirements to be deemed liveable, including operable plumbing, electricity, and locking doors and windows.</p> <p>Homes are considered move-in ready when they meet all legal code requirements. Age is not a factor. A move-in-ready home can be an <a href="/learn/what-is-the-cheapest-type-of-house-to-build" rel="noopener">affordable new construction</a> home or a 60-year-old house with minimal updates.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many buyers also consider the aesthetic of a home when looking for a house that’s move-in ready. A home can be move-in ready if there’s only some painting to do, but replacing old flooring or roofing is a lot more involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Flipped homes are often move-in ready, too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Flipped homes are properties that are purchased inexpensively, then renovated to meet modern tastes, so they’re both move-in ready and aesthetically appealing. Flipped homes can be a good option for buyers looking for a turnkey property that won’t require much upfront investment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consult a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/what-is-a-home-inspection"><span>home inspector</span></a> after you find a move-in ready home you like to make sure the home is up to code (especially if you are <a href="/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-out-of-state" rel="noopener">buying a home out of state</a> and don't know what the codes are in the new location). An inspector will help you understand what repairs may be needed in the coming years.&nbsp;</p> <h3>What Move-In Ready Doesn’t Mean</h3> <p>There are also some distinctions on what a move-in ready home isn’t.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/what-does-a-move-in-ready-home-include%20(2)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustrated chart explains what is included in a move-in ready home."></p> <p>Buying a move-in ready home doesn’t guarantee that its interior is modern or renovated. It also doesn’t guarantee you won’t want to paint.&nbsp;</p> <p>Furthermore, with a move-in ready home, you may want to make changes to the property’s exterior and landscaping, and major appliances may not be included.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your real estate agent can help you understand what comes with the house, and what you’ll have to buy separately.</p> <h2>8 Features of a Move-In Ready Home</h2> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/features-of-a-move-in-ready-home-(1)-png-1.jpg" alt="A family of first-time home buyers getting settled into their new home. The whole family looks totally joyous and not at all stressed about unpacking. Wish should all live a life like this. Except, in our lives, we'll label the moving boxes because WHY WOULD YOU NOT LABEL THE MOVING BOXES? Get a sharpie. Write KITCHEN or LIVING ROOM or HOME OFFICE on it - just write SOMETHING" loading="lazy" style="width: 737px;" width="737"></span></p> <h3>1. Working Plumbing and Pipes</h3> <p>Running water is a top priority for any home. Drains should be clean and clear without blockage, and all faucets should provide clean water.&nbsp;</p> <h3>2. Modern Electrical Outlets and Wiring&nbsp;</h3> <p>There is <a href="https://www.ecmag.com/section/codes-standards/article-210-branch-circuits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>a national electrical code</span></a> for homes built in the United States, and these rules state that every kitchen, bedroom, living room, and family room must have a working electrical outlet; along with any other room containing dedicated living space. There are specific rules for how outlets are spaced on the wall and special rules for outlets placed near running water.</p> <p>Older homes may not be built to today’s code and that’s okay. Just make sure your home inspector properly explains the risks and costs to remedy.&nbsp;</p> <h3>3. Leak-Proof Roof &amp; Exterior</h3> <p>In a move-in ready home, the roof is free from major and minor damage, including leaks, loose shingles, and discoloration. In addition, gutters and drainage systems are intact, and the home’s interior shows no evidence of water damage from a failed roof.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>For homes with siding, all siding pieces are structurally sound; and, for brick homes, the home’s tuckpointing is up-to-date and complete.&nbsp;</p> <h3>4. Major Appliances Included</h3> <p>A home seller isn’t required to leave their appliances for the next buyer of the property. Move-in ready homes will include refrigerators, freezers, and stoves; as well as laundry machines, heating and cooling systems, and dishwashers.&nbsp; Check the condition, age, and <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/energy-efficient-homes"><span>energy efficiency</span></a> of the appliances you’ll keep at purchase — some may be close to their replacement age.&nbsp;</p> <h3>5. Flooring and Walls Are Undamaged</h3> <p>In a move-in ready home, the floors are level and the walls are even. There are no obvious holes, no water stains in corners, and no evidence of physical warping. Mouldings around doors and windows are aligned, and doors and windows open and close as expected. Also, there are no gaps between ceilings and walls, or walls and floors.&nbsp;</p> <h3>6. Windows and Door Locks Operate As Expected</h3> <p>Move-in ready homes have locks on windows and doors for security, which can be changed by a locksmith after you’ve moved in. All single- and double-pane windows lock from inside the home, and first-floor windows have security sensors to detect intruders. Exterior doors have functioning double-locking mechanisms and, for homes with biometric key systems, system memory has been wiped prior to move-in.&nbsp;</p> <h3>7. Heating and Cooling Systems are Tuned Up&nbsp;</h3> <p>In a move-in ready home, heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems have had their filters replaced, their vents cleaned, and their damaged fan belts replaced. Refrigerant levels are acceptable, and there is no evidence of pest infestation.</p> <p>A well-maintained HVAC system can function for 20 years. Your home seller can tell you how many useful years remain in your HVAC system’s life.</p> <h3>8. The House Is Habitable&nbsp;</h3> <p>A move-in ready home has received its certificate of occupancy and adheres to local building code. It has running water and electricity. Its plumbing is working as expected. There is no mold. The home may need furniture and decorating to make it look pretty, but it’s habitable and safe for you and those you care about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <a id="flowchart" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Which Home is Right For You?</h2> <p>Before you buy your first home, spend time considering your must-haves, your wants, and your can-do-withouts. Then, use a <a href="https://homebuyer.com/pre-approval-warmup"><span>mortgage pre-approval</span></a> to set your budget and begin to search for your dream home.<span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p>If you’re not sure what kind of home you’re looking for, use this flowchart to find the best direction for you.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/what-kind-of-home-is-right-for-you-flowchart%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Flowchart asks questions to help you decide if a move-in ready home is right for you. "></p> <a id="printables" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Planning Your Move [+ New Home Printables]</h2> <p>When you’ve found your dream home and reached an agreement to buy it, it’s time to plan for your move.</p> <p>First, list all the updates and customizations you want to make in your new home. Some may be simple, like painting a bedroom. Some may be more complex, like wiring the house for ethernet. When your list is complete, separate items into two categories:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1">Items to update before moving in</li> <li aria-level="1">Items to update after moving in</li> </ol> <p>Replacing hardwood floors, for example, should be completed before you move in. Installing a fence for your dog, however, can happen at your leisure.</p> <p>Next, make a moving plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your plan should include:</p> <ol> <li aria-level="1">Packing the items you’ll bring to your home</li> <li aria-level="1">Moving your items into the home</li> <li aria-level="1">Unpacking the items after you’ve moved in</li> </ol> <p>Professional movers manage your move-in day, and some offer packing services. Movers should be booked early — especially if your closing is scheduled during the last week of a month, which is when movers are busiest.</p> <p>You can also move DIY. Loop in friends and reserve a moving truck and tools you’ll need like hand trucks and moving blankets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s a first home checklist to help you stay organized.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/first-home-essentials-checklist-mockup%20(1)-jpg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Mockup shows move-in ready home essentials."></p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/Move-In-Ready-Home-Essentials-Checklist%20(1).pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-first-home-essentials-button%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Click to download New Home Essentials Checklist."></a></p> <h2>Help Your Kids Prepare to Move</h2> <p>Moving to a new home is a significant adjustment for children. Talk with your children about their feelings, and involve them in your family’s move as much as possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Visit your new home and local locations, like parks, schools, and restaurants to help them get to know the neighborhood. Take walks around the block, <a href="/learn/how-to-meet-your-neighbors" rel="noopener">meet your new neighbors</a>, and plan their new bedroom decor to keep the experience exciting.&nbsp;</p> <p>For when you move in, download the printable below and go on a scavenger hunt together. Explore your new home, have fun, and make great new memories together.</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/new-home-scavenger-hunt-printable-mockup%20(2).jpg" alt="Child gets started on a new home scavenger hunt, which is really a sinister plot to get help from your kids and teach them to be self-sufficient.

		<post_date><![CDATA[April 19, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<a id="whatIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What is the Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021?</h2> <p><strong>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021 and the $25,000 First-Time Home Buyer Grant both refer to the same thing. We’ll be referring to them in this post interchangeably.</strong></p> <!--more--> <div class="hs-embed-wrapper" data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 747px; max-height: 415px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;"><div class="hs-embed-content-wrapper"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 55.56%; margin: 0px;"><iframe loading="lazy" width="747" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kV87bC9OYtk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></div></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021 would provide eligible first-time home buyers up to $25,000 cash which they could use for down payment, closing costs, mortgage interest rate reductions, and other home purchase expenses.</p> <p>Note that this is currently a bill and is subject to change by the time it becomes a law.</p> <p>As of April 19, 2021, its eligibility standards are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Must be a first-time home buyer</li> <li aria-level="1">Must meet income limitations for your area</li> <li aria-level="1">Must be purchasing a primary residence - no second homes or investments</li> <li aria-level="1">Must use a government-backed mortgage</li> <li aria-level="1">Must be a first-generation home buyer, or have parents or legal guardians who defaulted on a home loan, or lived in foster care during your lifetime</li> </ul> <p><a href="#requirements" rel="noopener">More on these requirements below.</a></p> <a id="whyIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Why Is This $25,000 Grant Important for First-Time Home Buyers?</h2> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021 is designed to help renters purchase homes, grow roots, and build their household wealth; and, also reduce racial disparity.</p> <p>The bill's opening paragraph states its goal:</p> <p>To provide downpayment assistance to first-generation home buyers to address multi-generational inequities in access to homeownership, and narrow and ultimately close the racial homeownership gap in the United States, and for other purposes.</p> <p>Homeownership matters because home equity is the largest wealth source in the United States - valued at <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/homeowneq.pdf"><span>more than $21 trillion</span></a> - and homeowners are overwhelmingly white.</p> <p>The homeownership gap between white and Hispanic households is currently 25 percentage points, and the difference between white and black households is currently 30 percentage points.</p> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act levels the playing field for disadvantaged groups. It's the most powerful piece of housing legislation since 1968's Fair Housing Act and Housing &amp; Urban Development Act. The program makes homes more affordable to disadvantaged buyers, <span>and incentivizes long-term homeownership</span>.</p> <p>Real estate wealth comes from compounding gains. Historically, the longer you own a home, the more wealth your household builds.</p> <a id="whoIs" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Who Is Eligible For The Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021?</h2> <p><strong>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act is a bill in Congress. Bills aren't law, and bills change before they're passed into law. Therefore, when we discuss eligibility requirements, we have to remember that the rules as they're written today can be different from when the bill is passed into law.</strong></p> <a id="requirements" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>Eligible home buyers must meet all of the following requirements:</p> <h3>Must be a first-time home buyer</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers are allowed to have owned a home in the past, but may not have owned a home or been co-signed on a mortgage loan within the last thirty-six months.</p> <h3>Must be a first-generation home buyer, or have lived in foster care</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers' parents or legal guardians may not have owned a home during the home buyer's lifetime unless a home was lost to foreclosure or short sale and the parents or legal guardians don't own a home currently. This requirement is waived for all home buyers who previously lived in foster care.</p> <h3>Must earn income that's above-average for an area, at most</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers must earn an income that's no more than 20 percent over the median income for a metropolitan area. For example, in Portland, Maine, where the median income is $60,000, home buyers must earn $72,000 per year or less to claim their cash down payment grant.</p> <p>Note that income exceptions can be made in high-cost areas, such as New York, Los Angeles, and other cities where the cost of living is high. In high cost areas, eligible home buyers must earn an income that's no more than 80 percent over the local median income. In San Francisco, eligible home buyers must earn $189,000 per year or less.</p> <h3>Must use Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA, or USDA</h3> <p>Eligible home buyers must use a mortgage that's backed by one of the five government mortgage agencies - Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA, and USDA. These entities allow for no down payment (USDA and VA), 3 percent down payment (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), and 3.5 percent downpayment (FHA). Jumbo mortgages are ineligible for the program, along with other non-qualifying mortgage loans.</p> <a id="howDoes" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Does the Downpayment Toward Equity Act Work?</h2> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021 is a cash grant for first-time home buyers. It's not a loan, and it's not a tax credit. It's a cash payment made to eligible buyers at closing to be applied directly to the purchase transaction.</p> <p>The standard cash award for first-time home buyers is twenty-thousand dollars.</p> <p>An additional five thousand dollars is available, too, according to the bill's draft version. To get it, home buyers must qualify as a "socially disadvantaged individual," which includes all people who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American, or any combination thereof; or, who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.</p> <p>Eligible home buyers can use the money as they please.</p> <p>For example, if you purchase a home for $100,000, you could use the $25,000 credit to make a big down payment, cover all of your closing costs, then pay extra to <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/should-you-pay-mortgage-discount-points"><span>get a lower mortgage rate</span></a>.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">$20,000 for a 20% downpayment on the home</li> <li aria-level="1">$3,000 for real estate and title closing costs</li> <li aria-level="1">$2,000 for access to a really low mortgage rate</li> </ul> <a id="howCan" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How Can You Receive Your $25,000 Down Payment Grant?</h2> <p>As of {{ datetimeformat(content.publish_date_local_time, '%B %e, %Y') }}, this grant is still in progress as a bill and no one will receive any money until it becomes a law.</p> <p>But, if it becomes a law, home buyers won't have to take action to collect their down payment grants. Mortgage lenders will do it for you, automatically. All you have to do is buy a home, show up at closing, and the money will be there waiting for you.</p> <p>Home buyers using the program are required to participate in home purchase counseling from a government-approved counselor.</p> <p>Most programs can be completed in 2 hours.</p> <p>If you are wondering whether <a href="/learn/is-now-a-good-time-to-buy-a-house" rel="noopener">now is a good time to buy a house</a> or if you should wait until this passes, it depends on your financial situation.&nbsp;</p> <a id="ifYou" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>If You Move Within 5 Years, You'll Have To Pay Some Money Back</h2> <p>For many homeowners, real estate wealth is transformative and generational which is why the Downpayment Toward Equity Act encourages a long-term view on homeownership.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to the bill's draft version, buyers who change their residence or sell within five years of purchase are required to forfeit back a portion of their initial grant.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 1: Repay 100% / $25,000</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 2: Repay 80% / $20,000</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 3: Repay 60% / $15,000</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 4: Repay 40% / $10,000</li> <li aria-level="1">Sell or move within Year 5: Repay 20% / $5,000</li> </ul> <p>There are exceptions to the repayment rule, and no repayments are required for buyers who stay in their home for at least five years.</p> <a id="whatOther" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Other Federal Down Payment Assistance Programs Exist For First-Time Home Buyers?&nbsp;</h2> <p>There are currently two down payment bills moving through Congress, both offer up to $25,000 towards down payment assistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act (this one), and the First Generation Down Payment Assistance via the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5187/all-info" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Housing is Infrastructure Act</a>.</p> <h3>What is the First Generation Down Payment Assistance via the Housing is Infrastructure Act?</h3> <p>The First Generation Down Payment Assistance offers a $20,000 grant to use towards home buying expenses. Similar to the Downpayment Toward Equity Act, the bill offers a higher amount of $25,000 for those who are socially or economically disadvantaged.</p> <p>The qualifying requirements for the Housing is Infrastructure Act are the same as the Downpayment Toward Equity Act in almost every way. The one difference is the definition of a first-generation home buyer.</p> <p>The Downpayment Toward Equity Act says that buyers’ parents or legal guardians may not have owned a home during the home buyers’ lifetime unless they lost the home to short sale or foreclosure. The Housing is Infrastructure Act says that buyers’ parents or legal guardians may not currently own a home.</p> <p>This small difference could help a lot more buyers qualify.</p> <p>This program is still a bill and not yet a law, so it is currently unavailable until it passes.&nbsp;</p> <a id="questionsOther" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>Questions Other Homebuyer Customers Are Asking About The $25,000 First-Time Home Buyer Grant</h2> <p>Here is a list of questions from other Homebuyer readers.</p> <p>If you have a question and it doesn't appear here, use the chatbox and we'll answer you live. We'll then add your question to this FAQ because if you're asking a question, there's a great chance another person has the same question, too.</p> <h3>Is the $25,000 First-Time Home Buyer Grant the same thing as the $15,000 Biden First-Time Home Buyer Tax Credit?</h3> <p>No, they are two separate bills. The $15,000 Biden <a href="/learn/15000-first-time-home-buyer-tax-credit" rel="noopener">First-Time Home Buyer Tax Credit of 2021</a> was a campaign talking point and is proposed as the <span>First-Time Homebuyer Act of 2021</span>. If passed, this would provide a $15,000 tax credit, after closing, from the IRS.</p> <h3>Is the $25,000 Home Buyer Grant available yet?</h3> <p>No, the $25,000 first-time home buyer grant program is still unavailable. It's currently a congressional bill that could pass in a few weeks, a few months, or maybe never. We expect that the bill will pass in some form before the end of the year. To be informed of the latest program news, Homebuyer publishes a special newsletter for this topic only.</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hello"><span>Register for our program emails here</span></a>.</p> <h3>How do I apply for the $25,000 Home Buyer Grant?</h3> <p>Eligible first-time home buyers don't need to apply for the $25,000 Downpayment Towards Equity Act grant. Your loan application includes the necessary information to trigger your qualification. Your mortgage lender will arrange to have your grant money waiting at your closing.</p> <h3>How do I know if I earn too much for the Downpayment Toward Equity Act of 2021?</h3> <p>First, type an address into <a href="https://onlinegeocoder.fanniemae.com/loanlimitgeocoder/pages/Online.aspx"><span>this government lookup</span></a>. If the 1-unit dwelling value is $647,200, to find the median income for your area, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/lapi1120_1.pdf"><span>use this chart</span></a> from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. When you find your median income, multiply it by 1.2 to find the maximum income allowed under the program.</p> <p>If the 1-unit dwelling value is above $647,200, multiply the median income by 1.8 to find the maximum allowed under the program.</p> <h3>If I have to move for work during the first five years, do I have to repay the $25,000 grant?</h3> <p>Yes, if you move or sell your home within five years using the program, you're required to pay back at least some of your grant.</p> <h3>If I'm a first-time home buyer but my fiancee is not a first-time home buyer, can we use the $25,000 First-Time Home Buyer Grant?</h3> <p>No, to use the $25,000 First-Time Home Buyer Grant, all home buyers must be first-time buyers who meet the program's eligibility standards.</p> <h3>Are there restrictions on how I use my first-time home buyer grant money?</h3> <p>Yes, you may use your grant funds to make a downpayment, pay for your closing costs, reduce your mortgage interest rate, and nothing else. In short, if the cost or fee is paid at closing, it's an eligible cost for the program.</p> <p>{{cta('0d860a55-feb6-4352-9199-544349a15c5b')}}</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/energy-efficient-homes]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[March 31, 2021]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>An energy-efficient home is designed to conserve and reduce energy use. A home’s construction, appliances, and major features can all impact efficiency, so there’s plenty to consider when shopping for your first home.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>More families are considering sustainable options for cost-efficiency and health, in addition to wanting to protect the environment. The growing eco industry means more contractors are conscious of how they build homes, too.&nbsp;</p> <p>When looking for a house, sustainability is definitely something to consider. You’ll want to work with a home inspector to assess major sustainability concerns, like insulation, but there are plenty of features you can identify on your own.&nbsp;</p> <p>Check out these important features of an energy-efficient home and <a href="#inspector" rel="noopener">questions to ask your home inspector</a>.</p> <p class="callout">Energy-efficient homes are designed to conserve and reduce energy usage without sacrificing the comforts of home.</p> <h2>1. Consider Your Home's Size and Shape</h2> <p>Your home’s size and shape can have a surprising impact on its energy-efficiency. A large home <a href="https://www.buildwithrise.com/stories/home-size-sustainability" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>requires more raw materials</span></a> to build and has a large surface area with increased opportunities for heat transfer and drafts, so the extra space will cost more to heat and cool.</p> <p>The home’s shape can impact efficiency, too. Open floor plans and rooms with high-ceilings are harder to keep warm. These rooms have more space to heat, which requires extra energy to keep things comfortable. Homes with more doors and walls create confined spaces, so your heating and cooling use less energy to maintain the temperature.</p> <h2>2. See Which Directions Your&nbsp; Windows Face</h2> <img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/which-directions-do-your-windows-face-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration shows how the cardinal direction your windows face impacts a room's temperature and natural lighting."><br> <p>The <a href="https://www.amokna.net/baza-wiedzy/windows-vs-cardinal-directions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>directions your windows face</span></a> has a direct impact on a room’s average temperature and natural light. You should consider how different rooms can be better served in different wings of the house.</p> <p>Rooms with windows facing the North and East won’t get an excess of light and they tend to be cooler than the rest of the house. North- and East-facing rooms are ideal settings for kitchens, which can generate their own heat and aren’t used so frequently that they need the extra light.&nbsp;</p> <p>South- and West-facing windows get a significant amount of direct sunlight, which can keep these rooms warm and well-lit without the need for electricity. This is perfect for rooms the whole family enjoys throughout the day, like living rooms. However, the summer months may make these rooms hot, so you’ll want blinds or curtains to manage the temperature.&nbsp;</p> <h2>3. Check That Windows and Doors Are Insulated</h2> <p>The entry points to your home can drain your home’s energy use. The Department of Energy estimates that <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/design/windows-doors-and-skylights/update-or-replace-windows" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>25% to 30%</span></a> of residential energy from heating and cooling your home is lost through windows.&nbsp;</p> <p>Be sure to consider your windows or doors. Windows, in particular, have advanced over the years and you may want to replace older, single-pane windows. Depending on the climate you live in, it may be worth considering storm windows, extra panes, or even gas-filled windows to help insulate your home.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll also want to check your windows and doors for proper fit and ensure that there aren’t any air leaks. You can check for drafts, noticeable gaps in the frames, and if anything sticks when opening or closing each window and door. It’s a good idea to have your home inspector double-check all entry points, too.&nbsp;</p> <h2>4. Study Up on Water Heaters</h2> <p>Water heaters account for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>19%</span></a> of the average home’s energy consumption, falling just behind heating and cooling for the largest residential use of electricity.</p> <p>Traditional water heaters store and heat large volumes of water at a time — and all of that water isn’t always used once it’s hot. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-and-cool/water-heating/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Tankless water heaters</span></a> are much more energy-efficient and only heat water as you need it.</p> <p>Tankless water heaters are typically boxes fixed to a wall rather than a large tank, so they’re easy to identify. Of course, it’s always a good idea to talk to your home inspector to learn more.&nbsp;</p> <h2>5. Take a Look at the Insulation</h2> <p>Insulation is essential for maintaining the temperature in your house. It prevents the thermal transfer from inside to the outside of your house, so your heating and cooling systems don’t have to work too hard.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cooling alone accounts for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=1174&amp;t=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>16% of residential energy consumption</span></a>, so it’s important to know how your home is insulated. Ask your home inspector to make sure the home’s insulation is effective and in good shape — especially if you’re considering buying an older home.&nbsp;</p> <h2>6. See If the Appliances Are Energy Star Certified</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/energy-star-reduce-energy-use%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration of a washer with the Energy Star logo — a signal of an energy-efficient appliance."><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Energy Star</span></a> ratings are available for EPA-certified, energy-efficient appliances. These certifications help consumers choose energy-efficient products and they’re easy to spot — just look for the blue Energy Star mark on certified appliances.&nbsp;</p> <p>When upgrading your appliances, it’s best to start with the appliances that have the largest impact on your energy use. <a href="https://www.fixr.com/pdf/resources/2019-energy-efficient-home-design-trends-fixr.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Home experts agree</span></a> that an Energy Star certified clothes dryer and refrigerator are the most effective energy-efficient upgrades.&nbsp;</p> <h2>7. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient Lighting</h2> <p>Lighting accounts for 5% of the average home’s energy consumption. Upgrading to LED lightbulbs throughout your home is an easy way to conserve energy. These bulbs only use 20% of the energy a traditional incandescent bulb does, and they last up to 25 times longer.</p> <p>You may also want to check that your light fixtures are energy-efficient. Check for Energy Star ratings and prioritize replacing fixtures in high-traffic areas like your kitchen and living room. Fixture features, including dimmers and timers, can positively impact your energy use, too.&nbsp;</p> <h2>8. Look For Moisture Control and Ventilation</h2> <p>An airtight home can prevent energy loss and protect your health. The fewer leaks there are in your home, the harder it is for internal air to escape and outside air to get in. This means that even in extreme temperatures, your heating and cooling don’t have to work as hard.</p> <p>Home experts say these are the five <a href="https://www.fixr.com/pdf/resources/2019-energy-efficient-home-design-trends-fixr.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>most effective locations to air seal</span></a>:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Window and door weatherstripping</li> <li aria-level="1">HVAC duct sealing</li> <li aria-level="1">Pipe wall penetrations</li> <li aria-level="1">Attic hatch opening</li> <li aria-level="1">Exterior wall outlet boxes</li> </ul> <p>Ask your home inspector to check for any air leaks and advice for improving your home’s air sealing and ventilation.</p> <h2>9. Scan For Smart Tech</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/smart-thermostats%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration of a thermostat includes the statistic &quot;smart thermostats can save you 8% on heating and 10% on cooling costs.&quot;">Smart appliances can automate everything from your home security to your morning routine. It’s no surprise that smart tech can also reduce your energy costs.</p> <p>Heating and cooling systems use more energy than other household appliances, so a <a href="http://energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>smart thermostat</span></a> is a great way to reduce your energy use. You can monitor and adjust your home’s temperature from anywhere and even set routines.</p> <p>Smart light systems work similarly to automate your energy use for conservation. Smart appliances like refrigerators and dryers also have creative solutions for energy problems. For example, some refrigerators have cameras inside so you can see what’s in your fridge without opening the door.&nbsp;</p> <h2>10. Check Out the Roof</h2> <p>Roofs see a lot of sunlight, so your roofing materials and color can impact your home’s efficiency. <a href="https://www.facilitiesnet.com/roofing/article/How-Cool-Roofs-Promote-Energy-Savings-Cooler-Cities--18646#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20saving%20energy,lower%20ambient%20outdoor%20air%20temperatures." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Cool roofs</span></a> are becoming a popular choice to reduce the amount of heat your roof retains from the sun.</p> <p>Roofs stay cool by reflecting the sun’s light instead of retaining it and generating heat. A light-colored roof is a good choice that will naturally reflect the sun’s light. If you want to keep the roof dark for appearances, then you can apply a membrane or other reflective coating to prevent heat retention.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cool roofs help maintain your home’s temperature and can also impact the air temperature outside. In fact, when several buildings in the community have cool roofs, cities can see lower energy demands and decreased emissions from power generation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ask your home inspector about the home’s roofing and what options may be available.&nbsp;</p> <h2>11. Ask About the Construction Materials</h2> <p>The most energy-efficient houses are planned for sustainability from the very beginning. The materials used in a home can affect its overall efficiency, especially when considering the foundation and insulation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are some eco-friendly materials you may find in a new home:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Insulated concrete walls</li> <li aria-level="1">Bamboo wood alternatives</li> <li aria-level="1">Recycled steel</li> <li aria-level="1">Vacuum insulation panels</li> <li aria-level="1">Structural insulated panels</li> </ul> <p>This is another feature that can be hard to spot, so consult with your home inspector.</p> <h2>12. Look at the Landscaping</h2> <p>A home’s landscaping can impact its energy-efficiency externally and internally. First, your landscape likely requires water and the <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/www3/watersense/pubs/outdoor.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>EPA estimates</span></a> that half of urban water use is for watering grass and gardens. A landscape made of moss or native plants rather than grass can reduce water requirements. The size of your yard also has a direct impact on the energy required to maintain the landscaping.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.globalgreen.org/blog/5-energy-efficient-landscaping-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Landscaping</span></a> can also help you conserve energy inside your home. Well-placed trees can provide relief from the sun during the summer months while allowing sunlight to help heat your home during winter. Similarly, a row of trees or hedges can protect the home from wind to better maintain the internal temperature.&nbsp;</p> <h2>13. Ask About Energy Star Certification for the Whole Home</h2> <p>Homes built with energy-efficiency in mind from the beginning are growing in popularity and often come with an <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/newhomes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Energy Star Certification</span></a>. These homes use 20% less energy on average and save you time and money on upgrades.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ask your real estate agent if the home is Energy Star Certified and what energy-efficient features are included.&nbsp;</p> <h2>14. Consider Alternative Energy Solutions</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/solar-panels%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Illustration of a home and sun with the statistic &quot;46% of homeowners in the U.S. have considered solar panels for their home.&quot;">Solar power is the leading source of residential renewable energy in the U.S. While only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/17/more-u-s-homeowners-say-they-are-considering-home-solar-panels/"><span>6%</span></a> of homeowners have made the switch, another 46% have seriously considered installing solar panels for their homes. Solar panels can protect the environment, reduce your energy costs, and may even <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>increase your home’s value</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, there are several options to produce <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/buying-and-making-electricity/planning-home-renewable-energy-systems" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>energy from home</span></a> besides solar energy. Depending on your home’s electricity use, climate, and local requirements, there are other possible energy options:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Wind energy</li> <li aria-level="1">Microhydro power</li> <li aria-level="1">Hybrid systems (solar and wind)</li> </ul> <p>Check your community rules and regulations to see what renewable energy options are available to you.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Questions to Ask Your Home Inspector</h2> <p>While there are plenty of energy-efficient home features you can spot yourself, you can’t know it all. A home inspector is a great resource to get the details on any home you plan to buy. Consult with your home inspector to know exactly what you’re getting with a new home and what upgrades could provide the best benefit.&nbsp;</p> <a id="inspector" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <p>Here are some key questions that can help you lead the conversation.</p> <p><strong>Questions about the home’s construction:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">What insulation does this home have and what condition is it in?</li> <li aria-level="1">Are all windows and doors installed properly?</li> <li aria-level="1">What kind of windows are installed in this home?</li> <li aria-level="1">Are there any air leaks in ducts or energy points to take care of?</li> <li aria-level="1">How is the air ventilation system included with this home?</li> <li aria-level="1">What building materials were used in this home?</li> <li aria-level="1">What materials were used on the roof? Is there a reflective coating?</li> </ul> <p><strong>Questions about the home’s appliances:</strong></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">What heating and cooling systems are installed in the house?</li> <li aria-level="1">What kind of water heater is installed in the home?</li> <li aria-level="1">Are included appliances energy-efficient?</li> <li aria-level="1">Does this house include any renewable energy sources?</li> </ul> <p>There’s plenty to consider when searching for your first home. Knowing what makes a house energy-efficient can help you choose a home that’s great for the environment, your health, and your wallet. Once you’re <a href="/pre-approval-warmup" rel="noopener"><span>pre-approved for a mortgage</span></a>, you can make your list of must-haves and get to house hunting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy homebuying!</p> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/what-makes-a-home-energy-efficient-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Energy-efficient home features infographic"></p>]]></post_content>

Even small credit score improvements can reduce the interest rate you get, which saves you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run — enough to fund a retirement or college tuition!&nbsp;</p> <a id="approval" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>What Mortgage Lenders Look For When Approving a Home Loan</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/credit-items-lenders-consider%20(1)-png.png" loading="lazy" alt="Mortgage lenders consider your credit history, your payment timeliness, and other factors as part of your credit score"></p> <p>When you apply to get pre-approved, your lenders will review your credit history and consider your current credit outlook. This includes looking at:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>How on-time have you been with your payments and obligations?</li> <li><span style="font-size: 1rem; font-family: Rubik, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">What does your current debt load look like, and how is it spread out?</span></li> <li>How much experience do you have managing credit?</li> <li>Have you been recently trying to acquire access to new sources of credit?</li> <li>Do you let items go into collections?</li> <li>Have you previously filed for bankruptcy?</li> </ul> <p>Lenders ask these questions to get comfortable with you. Your financial health isn’t the only consideration lenders make, but how you manage your bills tells a large part of your story.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lenders also look for specific credit events known as <em>derogatory items</em>, like bankruptcy or delinquent accounts.</p> <p>Derogatory items don’t disqualify a mortgage approval. Generally, it’s only required that they’re historical events and not current ones. For example, you can get approved for a mortgage if you’ve declared bankruptcy in the past, or if you’ve lost a home due to foreclosure.</p> <p>Lenders know that life is unexpected and bad things happen. What’s important is what’s happened in the time since the derogatory event occurred.</p> <a id="bad-credit" data-hs-anchor="true"></a> <h2>How to Buy a House With Bad Credit</h2> <p>You don’t have to give up on your dream of homeownership because of a low credit score or less-than-perfect credit history Here are a few ways first-time home buyers buy homes with bad credit or no credit:&nbsp;</p> <h3>Cancel Out Your Low Credit Score With A Larger Down Payment</h3> <p>Low credit scores create risk for mortgage lenders, and large down payments take the risk away. Therefore, buyers with the ability to increase their down payment size are more likely to get mortgage-approved.</p> <h3>Ask Multiple Lenders</h3> <p>The U.S. government establishes rules for conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loan approvals, but&nbsp; mortgage lenders sometimes create additional, more stringent requirements to be met. If your mortgage application doesn’t pass its first test, try again with a different mortgage lender. It’s common for loans to be approved on the second or third attempt.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Get a Co-Signer</h3> <p>If you’re unable to qualify for a mortgage and have somebody in your life who would serve as co-signer, ask your mortgage lender the best path forward. A <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/why-might-i-need-a-co-signer-in-order-to-get-vehicle-financing-en-811/#:~:text=The%20lender%20wants%20another%20person,a%20parent%2C%20or%20a%20friend.&amp;text=The%20co%2Dsigner%20is%20also%20obligated%20on%20the%20loan." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>co-signer</span></a> is somebody who agrees to joint responsibility for your mortgage, including repayment.</p> <p><span>Co-signers don't have to live with you, but they will share ownership of the home. If you can't qualify on your own, then this is worth exploring.</span></p> <p>Your credit score isn’t the only factor for <a href="/pre-approval-warmup" rel="noopener"><span>mortgage approval</span></a>. However, it’s a key indicator of your financial health.

This is how making mortgage payments is different from paying rent. Mortgages benefit you, and rent benefits your landlord.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>As a <a href="/" rel="noopener"><span>first-time homebuyer</span></a>, your priority is to select a monthly payment that works for your income. An at-home side hustle or passive income opportunity related to your home can pay your real estate taxes, homeowners insurance, and even upgrades to your home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are 10 ways to make money with your new house.</p> <p><em>Note: Some of these income streams may not align with current COVID-19 safety procedures and may be less viable considering current events.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>1. Get a Roommate</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/roommate_savings%20(1).png" alt="An illustration of 2 people moving with the statistic &quot;you may earn 30% of your monthly housing costs back with one roommate and up to 50% back with 3.&quot;" loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p>For generations, roommates have been a go-to way to save on rent, and roommates are just as beneficial when you own your home. Roommates help you cover your mortgage costs with cash each month, split your utility costs, and help with chores around the house — saving you time and money.&nbsp;</p> <p>Living with roommates isn’t always smooth sailing, though, and you have priority as the homeowner. This may cause conflict and force you to make difficult decisions. To minimize complications, set clear guidelines with your roommate(s) and have them sign a lease to protect your long-term investment.</p> <h2>2. Rent Out Your Yard</h2> <p>Amenities including big yards, backyard pools, and guest houses can help you pay your bills and <a href="/learn/how-to-meet-your-neighbors" rel="noopener">get to know your neighbors</a>. Advertise and share your home’s amenities at hourly or nightly rates that you set.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are apps that can help, too. <a href="https://www.sniffspot.com/host" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Sniffspot</span></a>, for example, lets you share your yard with your four-legged neighbors. They get a safe play experience and you earn a couple of dollars an hour.&nbsp;</p> <p>Similarly, <a href="https://swimply.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Swimply</span></a> lets you set an hourly rate for others to enjoy your pool. Neither venture is likely to cover your entire mortgage payment, but they’re excellent boosts to help you pay for maintenance and other expenses.</p> <h2>3. Grow a Garden</h2> <p>Gardens are beautiful to look at, and they grow delicious food. Fresh fruit and veggies are simple to grow in most climates, and you can sell your extra produce fresh, or make pickles, jams, and other preserves to sell year-round.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, flower gardens produce beautiful blooms and seeds you can sell, and you can rent a larger garden for photography and small events. For crafters, consider how you might dry flowers for use in jewelry, prints, and more to make the most of the natural beauty.</p> <h2>4. Create and Sell Products</h2> <p><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/side-hustlers%20(1).png" alt="Illustrated statistics that 1 in 3 side hustlers warn more than $500 a month in supplemental income. " loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"></p> <p>Your new home may be the perfect place to launch a small business. Running a business from home can be convenient and offers the added bonus of home office tax deductions.</p> <p>Here are a few popular home business ideas you may consider:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Home baking business</li> <li aria-level="1">Pet treats and accessories</li> <li aria-level="1">Jewelry art</li> <li aria-level="1">Woodworking and furniture refurbishing</li> </ul> <p>Some home businesses require certifications, licensing, or permits to operate from a home, so be sure to check with your local city government.</p> <h2>5. Offer Extra Space for Storage</h2> <p>For homes with extra space in a garage or a shed, consider renting that space as storage. Storage units cost an average of <a href="https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/blog/16906-how-much-does-a-storage-unit-cost/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>$90 a month</span></a>, and climate-controlled units are even more expensive. There are plenty of people in search of affordable, corporate alternatives, which you may be able to provide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Selling your extra storage space can also be a flexible venture. You may choose to accommodate short-term rentals for households who are in-between spaces and need to store some boxes temporarily. Alternatively, you may choose to rent your garage for a whole season to house an RV or a boat — whatever fits your lifestyle best.&nbsp;</p> <h2>6. Open a Home Studio</h2> <p>Home studios can be the perfect place to nurture a creative hobby and make some extra cash. Hobby artists, livestream gamers, and others can designate a space in the home to establish a brand and generate a profit.&nbsp;</p> <p>The best part is that you’ll be doing what you love.&nbsp;</p> <h2>7. Turn Your Home Into a Set</h2> <img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/set-location%20(1)-png.png" alt="An illustrated light and camera face a house with the stat that you can share your home as a set location and earn $2,000 a shoot." loading="lazy" style="width: 1520px;" width="1520"><br> <p>Owning a home in a popular film city like Atlanta or Palm Springs offers the unique opportunity to rent your home as a movie set. You don’t need a million-dollar mansion, either, since many movies and shows feature ordinary American homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even smaller cities get their share of work. Commercial shoots and advertising agencies also need home sets. If you’re interested in seeing your home on the big (or small) screen, connect with location agents, local film commissions, or check out apps like <a href="https://giggster.com/"><span>Giggster</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <h2>8. Host Events</h2> <p>A large property is super versatile and you can rent your space for weddings, concerts, and other events. This may require special permits, outdoor electricity, and bathroom arrangements — which can get costly. The good news is that one large event can bring in thousands of dollars in one day.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you live in a rural or agricultural area, consider agri-tourism activities like seasonal mazes, wine tastings, and mini-markets as popular ways to celebrate small-scale food production and community.&nbsp;</p> <h2>9. Share Your Parking Space</h2> <p>Parking can be pricey, especially when your home is in a densely-populated area. If your home has extra room in its garage or a parking space, apps like <a href="https://www.justpark.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>JustPark</span></a> make it easy to advertise and rent your space for short-term and long-term rentals.</p> <p>Similarly, if your home is near an event space or sports stadium, you can sell parking permission on your property for the duration of events. Again, this is super flexible and you can commit to a weekend hustle or a once-a-month venture.&nbsp;</p> <h2>10. Try Tutoring From Home</h2> <p>If you have a teachable skill, make extra money by sharing your expertise. Artistic lessons for musical instruments or painting and academic tutoring across an array of subjects are always in demand and can be conducted from your home or even virtually.&nbsp;</p> <p>Private academic tutors average <a href="https://tutorme.com/blog/post/how-much-should-you-pay-a-tutor-per-hour/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>$25</span></a> an hour for student tutors, and licensed teachers make closer to $56 an hour. Similarly, experienced music teachers earn an average of <a href="https://lessons.com/costs/piano-lessons-cost" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>$60</span></a> for an hour lesson.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a homeowner, you have opportunities to earn extra income that aren’t available when you’re renting where you live. No matter which side hustle you choose, your home can make it happen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy homebuying!</p> <p><a href="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/how-to-make-money-with-your-house.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://homebuyer.com/hubfs/download-visual-button%20(2)-png.png" loading="lazy"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>You're young and mobile. So, where should you move?</p> <!--more--> <p>Among the 50 United States, there are close to twenty-thousand incorporated cities. Each city offers different opportunities and possibilities. Some have an abundance of high-paying, entry-level jobs. Some are inexpensive and easy-to-navigate. Others are great for finding your tribe and making a life.</p> <p>You can move anywhere as a U.S. citizen. Yet, the majority of people live within <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 miles of their parents</a>. And, that's completely okay.</p> <p>But, if you're in looking to <a href="/learn/buying-a-house-in-your-early-20s" rel="noopener">buy a home in your twenties</a> or thirties and long to move to someplace new, or <a href="/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-out-of-state" rel="noopener">buy a home out of state</a>, you might want some help choosing your next, adopted hometown.</p> <p>What follows is our scientific analysis of the Best U.S. Cities for Millennials, ranked nationally and by region. We used data from more than 70 public resources and ignored such trendy statistics as the number of farmer's markets per capita; and, overall walkability.</p> <p>For each city, we asked: "If you lived here, could you make it?"</p> <p>That means:</p> <ul> <li>Is there a better-than-typical chance of getting a great job?</li> <li>Is it possible to earn a living, have a life, and still save money for your future?</li> <li>Can you find social and personal fulfillment there?</li> </ul> <p>These are the things that matter to humans, after all. It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.</p> <p>What are the best cities for Millennials? Where should you move after graduation? Use this list to get you started.</p> <h2>The Homebuyer "Best Cities" Methodology</h2> <p>Homebuyer performed a sizable amount of original research in our search for the Best U.S. Cities For Millennials.</p> <p>This is an objective analysis based on statistical studies and credible resources. The only component of our study that can be considered "opinion" is our opinion that Millennials should be able to afford the city in which they live.</p> <p>We would say that about any age group.</p> <p>Affordability matters to everyone. When your life is affordable, you give yourself options. You can use your excess money to buy a home with a low down payment (or a big one); to set aside money for retirement; and, to protect your loved ones with a proper life insurance policy.</p> <p>Including affordability, we identified six categories that matter to people of all ages and assigned a relative weighting to each.</p> <p>Then, using government and private sources, we logged local data for more than 3,500 cities -- from Abbeville, Louisiana to Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico -- before narrowing our data set down to the 100 most populous cities for people aged 20-34 where entry-level jobs are ample.</p> <p>We ranked these "Best Places for Millennials to Live" from A to F. The six categorical rankings are as follows.</p> <h3>1. How many entry-level jobs are available in the city? (7.5% of score)</h3> <p>When you're moving to a new city as a Millennial, you'll want to make sure you get the job you really want. So, an abundance of entry-level jobs in the city is important.</p> <p>To determine the number of full-time, entry-level job openings by city, we searched the Indeed.com database and set a 25-mile radius around each city center, with the assumption that Millennials will commute up to twenty-five miles for an entry-level job.</p> <p>After finding the number of available entry-level positions in a city, we adjusted it against U.S. Census Bureau data showing that city's population aged 20-34 which shows the relative strength of the entry-level job market for Millennials.</p> <h3>2. How much time is spent commuting in the city? (7.5% of score)</h3> <p>As human beings, time is our most valuable asset. How we spend it shapes who we are, and what we can accomplish. This is why we chose to include "time spent commuting" as part of Best Place For Millennials To Live study.</p> <p>The less time you spend commuting, the more time you have for interests and hobbies such as sports leagues, gaming, and hitting the gym.</p> <p>Using data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a> published by the U.S. Census Bureau, we found the typical travel time to work for workers over 16 years of age across the country who do not work from home.</p> <p>Data was split into 5-minute increments up to the forty-five minute mark, at which point larger increments were used. Each city was then assigned a score based on the number of minutes it takes to commute to work.</p> <p>Cities with lower commuting times were awarded higher point totals.</p> <h3>3. What's the public transportation situation like in the city? (10% of score)</h3> <p>Owning a car can add a lot to your monthly expenses.</p> <p>First, there's the cost of the car. Whether you chose to lease or buy your car, that monthly payment comes due each month, along with the cost of parking. In some cities, there's an abundance of street parking available at all times.</p> <p>More commonly, you're paying to park your car at home, at work, or both. Those costs can add up. You've also got the cost of gas; and, of car insurance (by the way, you should probably shop for cheaper car insurance).</p> <p>All of these reasons are why we considered the strength of each city's public transportation system in making our list of "Top U.S. Cities For Millennials".</p> <p>Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we gathered data on the number of workers age 20-44 who walk or take public transportation to work which includes trains, subways, buses, and ferries.</p> <p>Cabs and on-demand drivers such as Uber and Lyft are not considered public transportation.</p> <p>Cities with a higher percentage of workers who walk or who take public transportation to work were awarded higher scores.</p> <h3>4. How many other young people live there? (15% of score)</h3> <p>When you're moving to a new city and making a new life, it's important to find your tribe; people with common interests to you and with whom you can form relationships.</p> <p>This is why we researched the population density of young people in U.S. cities as part of the "Best Cities for Millennials in the United States" study.</p> <p>To find the population density of people in their twenties, we used the Census Bureau's American Community Survey to find the total population of people aged 20-29 within each of the country's urban areas, then compared that figure against the total number of people living in the same urban area.</p> <p>The higher a city's ratio of young people to its overall population, the higher that city scored in our system.</p> <h3>5. What's the after-work and weekend scene like in the city? (10% of score)</h3> <p>There's a positive correlation between the number of restaurants, bars, and clubs in a city, and its vibrancy.</p> <p>When you want to go out -- after work or on the weekend -- you want to have options. A city's food-and-social scene matters to Millennials looking for the best places to live. Using data in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html">Economic Census of the United States</a>, we found the number of food and drink establishments in a city and adjusted it against that city's total population aged 20-34 to find the number of restaurants, food trucks, coffee shops, bars, clubs, brunch spots, and other venues per person.</p> <p>Cities that boast more places to eat and drink per young person received higher scores than cities with fewer places to eat and drink.</p> <h3>6. How far does a paycheck get you in the city? (50% of score)</h3> <p>Your salary is not your paycheck. Your salary is what you earn. Your paycheck is what you take home after taxes and fees.</p> <p>Depending on where you live, your paycheck can be shrunk. Many cities levy taxes on people working within city limits to pay for public services such as parks and sanitation.</p> <p>Tax rates can be as high as six percent, or $6 from your paycheck for every $100 you earn.</p> <p>Furthermore, the value of your paycheck varies based on where you live.</p> <p>In some cities, renting an apartment, shopping for food, and buying clothes costs more than the national average. Your paycheck gets used up faster. There's less left over to spend on things such leisure, fun, and savings.</p> <p>We wanted to capture this dynamic as part of our "Best Places To Live" study for Millennials because it's a real-world event that's rarely discussed. Your salary may not be as important as you think.</p> <p>We did an abundance of research related to each city's entry-level salary range, taxes charged to workers by the city and state, and the city's specific cost of living to find what a dollar earned in each city is actually worth. We sourced income data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, referencing workers twenty-five years or older with a Bachelor's Degree; cost of living data from the government's Cost of Living Index as published in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed.html">Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>; and, tax data from each state's Department of Revenue and each city's City Office.</p> <p>There are multiple Cost of Living indices available through the Statistical Abstract of the United States. We chose the index that factors the cost of grocery items, housing, utilities, transportation, healthcare, and miscellaneous goods and services into its result.</p> <p>We ignored the cost of renters insurance because it's property specific and linked to additional coverages including personal liability and auto insurance, which can be bundled for discounts and savings. We computed the median earnings for each city, adjusted for state and local taxes; then, normalized that figure for the city's cost of living.</p> <p>This allowed us to rank every U.S. city by its relative income-earning potential. Cities in which workers keep more of their paycheck received the highest scores.</p> <h2>The Best U.S. Cities For Young People</h2> <p>There are a lot of ways to determine the best U.S. cities for young people today. We went scientific.</p> <p>Using data from more than 70 public resources, we built an algorithm for Millennials that shows the best places to live nationwide.</p> <p>We considered every city in every state and applied our mathematics fairly. We over-weighted cities that let you keep a large percentage of your paycheck; and, gave extra consideration to cities that make it easy to get around. We omitted subjective factors completely. You'll find no mention of the trendiness of a town, or its hipness.</p> <p>Grades are assigned based on statistics and our algorithm only. And, once you've found your city, you can use the most accurate home affordability calculator you'll find anywhere online to find how much home you can buy there, given your current rent levels.</p> <p>What are the best cities for Millennials? Where should you move after graduation? Use this list to get you started.</p> <p class="item-number">&nbsp;</p> <h3>1.

They're also subject to state limitations.</p> <p>Closing costs aren't paid in advance. On the date of signing, buyers bring their down payment to their closing, plus whatever closing costs are due.</p> <p>Buyers can also negotiate to have sellers pay their costs through seller concessions.</p> <p>Seller concessions is when a home seller applies a portion of its proceeds to the buyer's transactional expenses. This can include paying for the buyer's mortgage closing costs, settlement fees, and other taxes and fees.</p> <p>The third strategy for paying on closing is more advanced. It's called a zero-closing cost mortgage.</p> <p>With a zero-closing cost mortgage, the buyer willingly accepts a higher mortgage rate than it would other qualify for. In exchange for taking the higher rate, the buyer's lender pays its closing costs.</p> <p>Usually, a 0.25 percentage point increase creates a credit equal to one percent of your loan size. At today's mortgage rates, on a $100,000 mortgage, you get a $1,000 credit in exchange and pay twelve dollars more per month.</p> <p>Zero-closing cost mortgage works great for buyers without a lot of cash and who don't want to buy their forever home. </p> <p>Ask us your zero-closing cost mortgage questions in the chat box.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Home buyer competition is fierce. The buyers who win are the buyers who prepare.</p> <!--more--><p>The most successful home buyers do the same three things.</p> <ol> <li>They know their monthly housing budget</li> <li>They get pre-approved early in the journey</li> <li>They avoid dual agency with real estate agents</li> </ol> <p>Knowing your monthly budget means knowing how much money you can spend on housing, comfortably.</p> <p>For a lot of first-time home buyers, their monthly housing budget is similar to what they pay in rent. Your number may be higher or lower, but you can't shop for a home without knowing what you can afford to spend.</p> <p>Once you know your budget, get pre-approved to buy.</p> <p>Getting pre-approved to buy means that a mortgage company performed a dry run on your purchase, and determined you'd be approved for a loan given your chosen monthly payment.</p> <p>Lenders issue pre-approval letters to verify your approval status, which tells a seller, paraphrased, “This home buyer can afford to purchase your home, and their mortgage will be approved.”</p> <p>Sellers also don't accept offers from buyers who aren't pre-approved.</p> <p>Once you're pre-approved, join forces with a really good real estate agent.</p> <p>Good real estate agents will help you identify homes, guide you through your offer, and uses its experience to negotiate your best possible deal. Bad real estate agents do none of those things.</p> <p>Neither does the seller's real estate agent.</p> <p>Home buyers should not be represented by the same agent as the seller because the real estate agent's duty is to the listing. When the same agent represents both sides of the transaction, it's called Dual Agency, and Dual Agency favors the seller.</p> <p>Do these three things and you'll do great.</p> <p>Ask us your budget and pre-approval question in the chatbox.

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/document-cash-gift-for-downpayment]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[December 15, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 25% of first-time home buyers down payment gifts to help buy a home, according to the National Association of REALTORS®.</p> <!--more--><p>Mortgage lenders are fine about this.</p> <p>Lenders make no restriction on how small or big a cash gift for down payment can be. However, they will verify where the money came from to make sure the gift is “legal” and not an act of fraud.</p> <p>So, when you’re receiving a cash gift for help with buying a home, it's important to follow a process to meet your lender's requirements.</p> <h3>1. Have a proper mortgage gift letter</h3> <p>When you’re receiving a cash gift for down payment, write a formal gift letter, signed by all parties, that includes the following information:</p> <ul> <li>The gift giver’s name, address, and contact information</li> <li>The gift recipient’s name and relationship to the donor</li> <li>The dollar amount and approximate date of the gift</li> </ul> <p>Include language that <em>specifically</em> says the cash gift is a gift - not a loan. The difference between gifts and loans is that gifts don’t require repayment. Loans do.</p> <p>All parties must sign the down payment gift letter for it to be valid. Electronic signatures are acceptable.</p> <h3>2. Keep a documentation trail for the gift</h3> <p>Retain records that match the money changing hands with the gift letter that's been signed by all parties.</p> <p>You'll want to provide the following:</p> <ol> <li>A copy of the withdrawal receipt from the gift giver’s bank</li> <li>A copy of the deposit slip or bank record from the gift receiver's bank</li> </ol> <p>Physical and digital formats are acceptable, so use whichever is easier.</p> <h3>3. Deposit the gift into your account, by itself</h3> <p>Deposit your cash gift into your account, non-commingled with other monies. The figures in your documentation trail must match the figures in your gift letter exactly. Commingling a deposit makes that impossible, and may negate your ability to use the money at all.</p> <p>Ask us your cash gift question in the chat. We're here to help.</p>]]></post_content>

Your lender loses, too.</p> <p>Insurance helps pay for repairs and replacements after a disaster. It restores homes to their original, full market value.</p> <p>Imagine if you didn’t have insurance, and your roof sprung a leak. Could you immediately pay for repairs from your savings? How would that affect your budget?</p> <p>Or, what if you delayed repairs for a few months while you built up sufficient reserves? What other damage might occur to your home because of the leak, and how might that cause your home’s value to drop?</p> <p>Scenarios such as this are why mortgage lenders require home buyers to carry homeowners insurance. With insurance, repairs can be made immediately.</p> <p>Homeowners insurance does more than protect your asset — it also protects your debt.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p><span>The word mortgage is rooted in the 1400s. It comes from the combination of two words - the Latin word <em>mortuus</em>, which means death; and, the Old French word <em>gage</em>, which means pledge.</span></p> <!--more--><p><span>In other words: the literal meaning of <em>mortgage</em> is a pledge to repay even after we've died.</span><span></span><span></span></p> <p><span>It's part of the contract. In exchange for lending you money, your lender expects payments each month until your contract is fulfilled - usually in 30 years. </span></p> <p><span>But, should you die within that time period, your contact doesn't die with you. Payments are still due each month because your loan still has a balance.<br></span></p> <p>This possibility of death is why every homeowner with a mortgage should also have a policy for life insurance.</p> <p>Life insurance policies pay cash when the policy-holder dies. The cash payment can pay off the deceased’s mortgage loan, and retire the debt.</p> <p>When you die and don't have life insurance, the loved ones you leave behind have a choice: find a way to keep making payments or sell the house.</p> <p>At a minimum, your life insurance coverage should be large enough to retire all of your debts including your mortgage, student loans, and credit cards; plus the cost of a funeral service.</p> <p>This is the <em>minimum</em> recommended coverage. You can – and might want to! – add to the size of your life insurance policy for extra cash payouts.</p> <p>In general, a healthy home buyer in their 20s and 30s can purchase $1,000,000 worth of life insurance for $35 per month. That’s usually more than enough to pay off a house and debt; and provide security to a family.</p> <p>Ask us your questions about life insurance and mortgages in the chatbox.

		<post_date><![CDATA[December 14, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>A deductible is the amount of money that an insurance company withholds when paying a homeowner’s insurance claim.</p> <!--more--><p>Deductibles are designed to reduce moral hazard, such as a homeowner deciding not to install smoke alarms because “insurance will pay for the damage,” or not installing a home security system because “insurance will pay for anything stolen.”</p> <p>Homeowners choose the size of their insurance deductible. The three most common deductible sizes are:</p> <ul> <li>$250</li> <li>$500</li> <li>$1,000</li> </ul> <p>When you choose a larger deductible, the cost of your homeowners insurance policy drops because your insurer pays less money for damages and claims.</p> <p>Imagine a storm causes damage to your home. A falling tree crashes through your roof. You call a roofing repair company and it assesses the damage at $1,000.</p> <p>You file a claim with your insurance company.</p> <ul> <li>If your deductible is $250, the insurance company sends you $750 for repairs</li> <li>If your deductible is $500, the insurance company sends you $500 for repairs</li> <li>If your deductible is $1,000, the insurance company send you nothing</li> </ul> <p>Deductibles apply to all of the insurance types you might use as a homeowner: homeowners, auto, earthquake, flood, and umbrella insurance.</p> <p>For help picking your deductible size, ask us your question in the chat box.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_date><![CDATA[December 11, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>Adjustable-rate mortgages. Or, as most people just call them arms – A R M.</p> <!--more--> <p>They are home loans where the interest rate changes once per year after some initial time frame has passed, and for some homebuyers, ARMs are a perfect fit.</p> <p>Adjustable-rate mortgages offer a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates, lower monthly payments, and a lesser chance that you’ll overpay to live in your home.</p> <p>So ARMs work like this. You get a beginning interest rate from your lender and that rate lasts for some number of years of your choice. Maybe one, three or five or seven or ten, and then after that first block of years ends, a new rate is assigned based on the health of the economy.</p> <p>When the economy is doing well in general, your interest rates go up. And, when the economy is not doing well, in general, your interest rates go down.</p> <p>But here’s the good part.</p> <p>When you use an ARM your lender will never move your rate more than a handful of percentage points from where your rate started – either up or down. This means that even though your rate is changing, it’s changing within a very narrow band and that’s why it’s good to at least consider an adjustable-rate mortgage on your purchase, and more so when the home you’re buying isn’t going to be your forever home.</p> <p>ARM mortgage rates are offered at discounts to fixed-rate loans like the 30- year and those discounts can add up to big savings.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/how-big-should-my-deductible-be]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[December 8, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<h2>$250 Deductible: When you live paycheck-to-paycheck and don’t have much savings</h2> <p>When you choose a $250 deductible, your out-of-pocket costs stop at $250 after a loss that requires an insurance claim.</p> <!--more--><p>Your insurance company covers your loss, minus the $250 that represents your deductible.</p> <p>Choosing a $250 deductible works for people who have little or no money left at the end of a month, and whose bank accounts aren’t as large as they’d like.</p> <p>The trade-off of a smaller-sized deductible: higher monthly premiums.</p> <p>An insurance plan with a $250 deductible may cost 20 percent more as compared to a larger-deductible plan. So, if you can afford to pay more than $250 out-of-pocket after an accident or a loss, choose a higher deductible amount.</p> <p>Otherwise, the $250 deductible works great.</p> <h2>$500 Deductible: When you’re getting by, and have some money saved up</h2> <p>When you choose your insurance company’s $500 deductible option, your insurance company caps your out-of-pocket costs to repair, replace, or remedy at $500.</p> <p>Your insurance company pays for damages in full, minus your $500 deductible.</p> <p>Choosing a $500 deductible is good for people who are getting by and have at least some money in the bank – either sitting in an emergency fund or saved up for something else.</p> <p>The benefit of choosing a higher deductible is that your insurance policy costs less.</p> <p>So, if you feel good about your cash savings and can reasonably make $500 payment after an accident or loss, choose the the $500 deductible.</p> <h2>$1,000 Deductible: When you’re living comfortably, and feel good about your savings</h2> <p>Choosing the $1,000 deductible option limits your out-of-pocket costs after an insurance claim to $1,000. Your insurance company pays all of your damages – minus your $1,000 deductible.</p> <p>The $1,000 deductible is good for people who earn a healthy income and who have sufficient savings to handle unexpected events, such as car accidents, damages to the home, and the theft of valuables.</p> <p>Choosing a $1,000 deductible lowers your policy costs considerably. High-deductible insurance costs at least 20 percent less when compared to low-deductible policies.</p> <p>Just make sure you have at least $1,000 available in savings at all time.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_title><![CDATA[9 Things FHA Mortgages Can Do]]></post_title>
		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/are-fha-mortgages-good]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[December 7, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>The first FHA mortgage loan was made in 1934. It's the original U.S. mortgage loan.</p> <!--more--><p>Nine decades later, 1-in-5 home buyers use FHA loans, and it’s the most inclusionary loan program in the world.</p> <ul> <li>You don’t need a 20 percent downpayment with FHA loans</li> <li>Buyers of all credit types can be approved</li> <li>You can earn a modest income and still be FHA mortgage-approved</li> </ul> <p>This list shows nine reasons why FHA loans remain popular.</p> <h3>1. FHA-backed mortgages require just 3.5% down</h3> <p>For all home types, FHA-backed mortgages require a down payment of 3.5 percent — $3,500 for every $100,000 in your home’s sale price. Most home buyers using the FHA program put down between 3.5 and five percent.</p> <h3>2. The FHA mortgage program is inclusive</h3> <p>There are no “special” qualification standards with the FHA mortgage program. You can live in any type of home, in any U.S. city, and get FHA-approved.</p> <p>You don’t even need a social security number. Non-permanent resident aliens can use FHA mortgages; and, so can employees of the World Bank and foreign embassies.</p> <h3>3. FHA mortgages are flexible about your credit rating</h3> <p>You don’t need perfect credit to get approved for an FHA mortgage. You don’t need an above-average rating. FHA mortgage guidelines instruct lenders to look beyond a person’s credit score and find the “bigger picture.”</p> <p>Officially, the FHA doesn’t enforce minimum credit score requirements – you can get an FHA approval without a credit score.</p> <h3>4. FHA mortgages allow cash gifts for a downpayment</h3> <p>When you buy a house and use an FHA-backed home loan, your entire down payment can be a cash gift from a parent or relative; or, an approved charitable group or foundation.</p> <h3>5. FHA mortgages can be fixed or adjustable, 30 years or 15 years</h3> <p>FHA mortgages can be customized to match your specific needs. Home buyers can choose between fixed-rate or adjustable; and, between a loan length of 15 years or 30 years.</p> <h3>6. FHA mortgages can be transferred to a future home buyer</h3> <p>FHA mortgages are <em>assumable</em>, which means that your loan can be taken over by the eventual buyer of your home, with the same interest rate you have today. Assumable mortgages can give you an advantage over other sellers in the future — especially if interest rates climb.</p> <h3>7. You get access to the FHA Streamline Refinance</h3> <p>When you have an FHA mortgage, you get access to a unique mortgage refinance program called the FHA Streamline Refinance. The FHA Streamline Refinance is a fast and easy way to lower your interest rate. There’s no income or employment verification, no check of your credit, and no appraisal performed of your home.</p> <h3>8. FHA mortgages can be used for multi-unit homes</h3> <p>For multi-unit homes, FHA mortgage rates are often lower as compared to other types of mortgages. Down payment requirements for multi-unit FHA loans are typically smaller, too.</p> <h3>9. FHA closing costs can be paid by the seller</h3> <p>It’s common for home sellers to pay FHA loan closing costs on behalf of home buyers through an option called <em>seller concessions. </em>With seller concessions, the home seller can designate up to 6 percent of a home’s sale price to you to offset loan fees, costs, and taxes.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/jumbo-mortgages-chat-questions]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[December 3, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Jumbo mortgage loans account for 5% of mortgage loans made nationwide.</p> <!--more--><p>Here are the most common questions home buyers ask about jumbo loans, and the answers to those questions.</p> <h3>What’s the difference between a jumbo and non-jumbo mortgage?</h3> <p>The defining difference between a jumbo mortgage and a non-jumbo mortgage is loan size. Jumbo mortgages exceed the local conforming mortgage loan limits for an area.</p> <h3>What are the standard terms of a jumbo mortgage?</h3> <p>Jumbo mortgages aren’t standardized; they’re not like FHA mortgages, VA mortgages, or other government-backed mortgages. The bespoke nature of jumbo loans is the entire point.</p> <h3>What’s a portfolio loan? Is it the same as a jumbo loan?</h3> <p>A portfolio loan is a loan that a mortgage lender keeps in its investment portfolio instead of selling the loan through Wall Street for securitization. All jumbo loans are portfolio loans.</p> <h3>What is a mortgage loan limit?</h3> <p>Mortgage loan limits are the largest-sized mortgage loans that the government will agree to back. Loan limits vary by U.S. county and by mortgage-backing agency.</p> <h3>Are jumbo loans harder to get approved than conforming loans?</h3> <p>No, jumbo loans aren’t harder to get approved as compared to other loan types — they require a different series of steps, though. Sometimes, more effort is required, and sometimes less effort is required. Your experience will vary based on your individual circumstance.</p> <h3>When I pay my jumbo loan each month and the balance drops below my local loan limit, does my mortgage transform into a conforming loan?</h3> <p>Jumbo loans do not turn into conforming loans when their remaining loan balance falls below local mortgage limits. Once a jumbo, always a jumbo.</p> <h3>What credit rating do I need for a jumbo mortgage?</h3> <p>Jumbo loans don’t have minimum credit ratings, per se. However, borrowers with higher credit ratings can be approved for a wider range of jumbo loans, which may result in lower interest rates.</p> <h3>How long does it take to approve a jumbo loan?</h3> <p>Jumbo loans don’t take more or less time to approve as compared to other loan types. Most mortgage lenders can close a jumbo loan in 3 weeks or fewer.</p> <h3>What is the down payment requirement for a jumbo loan?</h3> <p>There are no specific down payment requirements for a jumbo mortgage. Borrowers can make large down payments if they want, or they can make no down payment at all, depending on the specific jumbo loan type and the lender that offers it.</p> <h3>Can I get a jumbo mortgage if I’m self-employed for less than two years?</h3> <p>Yes, you can get a jumbo mortgage if you’re self-employed for less than two years. Jumbo mortgages don’t have specific self-employment requirements.</p> <h3>Do I need mortgage insurance with a jumbo mortgage?</h3> <p>Sometimes, but usually no. Mortgage insurance is not always required with jumbo loans.</p> <h3>What are the jumbo mortgage closing costs?</h3> <p>Jumbo mortgage closing costs are similar to closing costs on other loan types. However, some mortgage lenders will require two home appraisals for a jumbo mortgage approval. An extra appraisal can add a few hundred dollars to your closing costs.</p> <h3>Can I use jumbo loans to buy a vacation home?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use jumbo loans to buy a vacation home.</p> <h3>Can I use jumbo loans to buy a rental property?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use jumbo loans to buy a rental home.</p> <h3>Can I use jumbo loans for a multi-unit home?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use jumbo loans to buy multi-unit homes, including 2-unit homes, 3-unit homes, and 4-unit homes.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_date><![CDATA[December 2, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>The FHA mortgage program is the original U.S. home loan.</p> <!--more--><p>The program dates to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934">the National Housing Act of 1934</a>, ten years before the VA loan program for veterans was created, and thirty years before the first conventional mortgage was made.</p> <p>Before the FHA, mortgage loans were different.</p> <p>80 years ago, mortgage loans came from community banks. Banks took deposits from neighborhood families, then lent those deposits out as home loans.</p> <p>Banks required down payments of 40% or more on their loans, and insisted that loans were paid back in five years or fewer.</p> <p>As the economy spiraled downward during the Great Depression, unemployment rates climbed. Homeowners were unable to repay their loans in the community which led to a 6,000 percent increase in bank failures.</p> <p>The housing market lost 29 percent of its value.</p> <p>The government created the Federal Housing Administration to jump-start lending, and put an end to the Great Depression. The agency offered insurance to mortgage lenders for loans that might go bad.</p> <p>With FHA mortgage insurance available, banks felt safe to make loans to home buyers. Housing led the U.S. economy out of the depression.</p> <p>The FHA remains integral to U.S. housing and first-time home buyers. It's the largest insurer of loans in the world.</p> <p>To qualify for FHA mortgage insurance:</p> <ul> <li>Loan lengths must be 15 years or longer</li> <li>Loan payments must include principal + interest payment</li> <li>Income and credit standards must be maintained</li> </ul> <p>All home buyers who meet FHA mortgage insurance standards qualify for an FHA mortgage.</p> <p>Ask us your FHA mortgage questions in the chatbox.

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/15-year-mortgage-payment]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[December 1, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>When you buy a house, your mortgage won’t be one-size-fits-all because, as the buyer, you’re in control and you get to pick how your loan gets put together. And one of the choices you get to make is over how many years you pay back your loan.</p> <!--more--> <p>The most common choice? Thirty years, and that’s because a 30-year loan spreads payments out over three decades which makes for lower payments.</p> <p>But the second most common choice is the fifteen-year loan, which compresses your payment into half the time – but don’t expect a payment that’s twice as large – usually it’s only about two-thirds of that, which means that choosing a fifteen year mortgage save you money in the long run, even as it costs more today.</p> <p>And, those savings get a boost from the lower interest rates of a fifteen year mortgage because lenders prefer that their loans are paid back in fewer years if they can help it.</p> <p>So, there are advantages of using a fifteen-year home loan, but that choice and its payment will cause you stress or strain your budget, stay clear. Shorter mortgage terms are an option you have as a buyer and that’s all. You’re not forced to it.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>Did you know: how much you pay in mortgage closing costs is usually within your control? It’s an idea that’s new to most people and here’s how it works.</p> <!--more--> <p>With every mortgage, there are closing costs. Your lender has costs, your title company has costs, there are fees to get paid. And, they’re the same on every loan. A lender can’t charge different fees to different consumers for the same service because that could be discriminatory.</p> <p>But, you can choose how much of those fees you pay from your own pocket.</p> <p>Now, you may have heard of points, which are a one-time fee you pay to get access to lower rates. They’re sometimes known as “discount points” because when you pay them, you get a “discount” on your mortgage rate. Pay one discount point, get a point-two-five reduction in your mortgage rate — as an example.</p> <p>Well, you can do the reverse of points, too.</p> <p>You can pay fewer loan closing costs in exchange for taking a higher mortgage rate. Your closing costs are still there, but in this reverse points setup — which loan officers call REBATE — your costs get paid by the lender and you pay nothing in upfront cash.</p> <p>The trade-off here, of course, is that you’re taking a higher mortgage rate — usually by an eighth or quarter percentage point — but you’re also not paying closing costs.</p> <p>So, pay points or fees with your money, and get a lower rate. Or, don’t pay points or fees, and get a higher rate. There’s no best choice here — it’s whatever works for you. And, if you want some help with the math for your particular situation, drop us a note in the chat.</p> <p>Happy homebuying.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>Did you know: What you’ll pay in mortgage closing costs is typically within your control? That comes as news to most people.</p> <!--more--> <p>Here’s how it works.</p> <p>With every mortgage, there are costs. You pay costs for people, for technologies, and for the various services rendered. And by law, those costs must be the same for every loan. Lenders can’t charge different fees to different consumers for the same service provided because that kind of practice is discriminatory.</p> <p>As a home buyer, though, how your costs are paid is up to you. You retain control.</p> <p>Have you ever heard of points? They’re the one-time fee for access to lower rates than you might otherwise be offered. Points are sometimes called “discount points” because they get you “discounts” against your mortgage rate, but they cost money.</p> <p>Well, there’s a reverse of points, too.</p> <p>Instead of paying additional fees for access to lower rates, you agree to pay fewer fees in exchange for taking a higher rate. This reverse points setup — which lenders call REBATE — can usually be used to lower your closing costs completely and it’s common for buyers to make use of at least some form of closing cost credit with their loans.</p> <p>Use the chatbox below to let us know what you think about closing costs, and how we can help you choose what’s best.</p> <p>And, happy homebuying.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>To your lender, the most important number in the world is the one that measures how much you earn versus how much you spend.</p> <!--more--> <p>It’s called your debt-to-income ratio and it’s the basis for nearly every mortgage approval made today. Even more than your credit score, your debt-to-income often reflects your true ability to repay, which makes lenders want to say tell you “yes”.</p> <p>In general, lenders want to see debt-to-income levels below forty-five percent, which means that for every hundred dollars you earn, they want no more than forty-five dollars committed to ongoing debts such as car loans, student loans, credit cards, and other debt types.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, lenders limit buyers to a percentage somewhere in the thirties. It depends on the buyer and how much they’re borrowing, putting down, and their overall credit score makeup. Also, not everyone wants to borrow as much as a lender’s willing to approve.</p> <p>Talk to us in the chatbox below about your approval questions.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>The surest way to ruin your budget is to shop for homes by their sticker price.</p> <!--more--><p>The price of a home is not what it costs you.</p> <p>A home's cost is the payment you make to live there, which is a sum of 4 figures:</p> <ol> <li>Your monthly mortgage payment</li> <li>Your annual real estate tax bill costs</li> <li>Your annual insurance costs for the home</li> <li>Your annual home maintenance costs</li> </ol> <p>There's also a fifth component for buyers of condos and homes in planned communities – monthly association dues.</p> <p>A for-sale prices doesn't capture these elements.</p> <p>The better way to shop for homes, then, is to shop by monthly payment.</p> <p>To illustrate, let’s look at two fictitious for sale. They’re both for sale at $200,000. They're built by the same builder. They have identical floor plans and finishes, and are the same in every possible way.</p> <p>The only difference between two properties is that they’re on different streets, which, coincidentally, puts the two homes in different census tracts.</p> <p>Suddenly, these $200,000 listings look different.</p> <p>The first home is closer to the nearest police and fire stations, and in a tax-advantaged census tract based on average resident income and minority concentration. The second home's census tract is not tax-advantaged.</p> <p>Should you buy the first home, you get access to:</p> <ul> <li>Mortgages with subsidized, below-market interest rates</li> <li>Lower real estate tax bills</li> <li>Lower insurance costs because of emergency service proximity</li> </ul> <p>The second home gets none of those benefits.</p> <p>The second home, therefore, costs more to own despite having the same sales price. Shopping for homes based on price won't help you.</p> <p>Shop for homes by monthly payment.</p> <p>Ask us your home budget question in the chat. We're here to help.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_content><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The Housing Headline</strong></h2> <p>Home buyers have 12 percent more purchasing power as compared to last year.</p> <!--more--><h2><strong>The News Behind The Housing Headline</strong></h2> <p>30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates have dropped close to a full percentage point from a year ago, raising your upper purchase price range by 12 percent.</p> <p>The data comes from government mortgage agency Freddie Mac and its weekly mortgage rate survey of more than one hundred U.S. lenders.</p> <p>This week’s survey shows the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate at 2.72 percent nationwide for buyers willing to pay an optional, one-time discount fee of 0.7 percent at closing.</p> <p>The same mortgage product averaged 3.66 percent last year.</p> <p>Home buyers have more purchasing power.</p> <ul> <li>In 2019: $200,000 mortgage = $916 monthly payment</li> <li>In 2020: $225,000 mortgage = $916 monthly payment</li> </ul> <p>This week’s surveyed rates are the lowest since Freddie Mac started tracking them in 1971.</p> <h2><strong>Why This Housing News Matters To You</strong></h2> <p>Mortgage rates change quickly. Home prices change slowly.</p> <p>It's why home buyers shouldn't ask “How much house can I afford?” but, instead, “How much house can I afford today?”</p> <p>Mortgage rates affect home affordability more than home price changes.</p> <p>Every 1/8 percentage point change in mortgage rates is equivalent to a 1.5% rise (or fall) in home prices. Mortgage rates often move by that amount daily.</p> <p>As rates drop this year, home buyers find themselves with 12% more purchasing power. It's safe to upgrade your home search filters.</p> <p>With your added purchasing power, you can now look for:</p> <ul> <li>Homes with an extra bedroom or bathroom</li> <li>Renovated homes instead of fixer-uppers</li> <li>Homes in higher-rated school districts</li> </ul> <p>If a year ago, a $200,000 home fit within your budget, today, you can look for a $225,000 home for the exact same payment.</p> <p>For help finding your maximum purchase price on today's mortgage rates, use the chat and ask us your question.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/why-use-a-low-down-payment-mortgage]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[November 18, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<h3>Video Transcript</h3> <p>Let us just agree – low-down payment loans and no down payment loans are neither a bad thing nor a good thing — they’re just a thing.</p> <!--more--> <p>Because when you’re buying a house and you choose to make a small down payment or no down payment at all, it doesn’t mean you can’t afford a home or that you shouldn’t buy one. It just means that you’d rather use your cash for other purposes than making down payment. That’s it.</p> <p>The better gauge for whether a person can afford a house is how their housing payment affects their monthly budget.</p> <p>That’s the true measure of affordability.</p> <p>And, when owning a home doesn’t affect your ability to pay your bills, or save for retirement, or have cash available for an emergency, then you can afford it.</p> <p>And that’s what low and no-downpayment mortgages are for — to keep you from tying up too much of your money in your house when you think you might need it for other things.</p> <p>Because life doesn’t move in straight lines and when things go sideways — and they always do — it’s great to have money in the bank. Low downpayment loans aren’t for everybody but they can be an important part of your financial bigger picture.</p> <p>Happy homebuying!</p>]]></post_content>

If it contains a shared yard, you own a percentage of the yard.</p> <p>To manage common areas, condominium owners elect a Homeowners Association to serve them whose primary responsibility is to keep the community running smoothly, and to maintain a Condominium Master Insurance Policy which insures the common areas of a building against damage.</p> <p>Mortgage lenders approve condos differently from stand-alone homes.</p> <p>If you're thinking about buying a condominium, you may need a larger down payment or different credit score.

It's when paperwork is signed, the money changes hands, and house gets conveyed from the seller to you - the buyer!</p> <p>Closings typically occur in a real estate agent’s office, or at a local title company. You attend with your real estate agent and whomever else you want to have with you.</p> <p>A notary will be present in-person or by video to officiate the transaction.</p> <p>You'll be asked to you have two items with you:</p> <ol> <li>Photo identification</li> <li>A cashiers check or proof of wire of your monies due</li> </ol> <p>Then, you'll sign boilerplate documents which convey the property to you; and, affirm that you haven't made false statements to your lender. You may be asked to sign by hand, or electronically - both are common and legal.</p> <p>Once you're done signing, the officiant will look for errors and omissions. If none are found, the officiant will confirm your balance due, release your lender’s money to the seller, and await confirmation that the seller is in receipt.</p> <p>After that, your closing is complete! You get your keys and go home to your new house.</p> <p>Closing can finish in as few as 15 minutes, but can extend for hours when buyers ask questions or mistakes are found. Most home buyers get their keys within an hour.</p> <p>Ask us your closing question in the chat.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_date><![CDATA[November 17, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>According to the National Association of REALTORS, roughly 25% of first-time home buyers receive cash gifts to help with their down payment.</p> <!--more--><p>Cash gifts to buy a home are allowed, and can come from a variety of sources:</p> <ul> <li>Parents</li> <li>Grandparents</li> <li>Fiancé / Fiancée</li> <li>Friends</li> <li>Employers</li> </ul> <p>Mortgage lenders allow cash gifts in all sizes - from a few hundred dollars to a few hundred thousand dollars. All gifts require documentation.</p> <p>To document a cash gift for down payment, you must show proof of the gift money leaving your gifter’s bank account and entering into your own. This can be accomplished with receipts from the withdrawal and receipts from the deposit.</p> <p>It can also be proved with wire transfer receipts.</p> <p>Second, your cash gift for down payment must be accompanied by a letter that lists the name and address of everyone involved, and states that the gift is actually a gift and requires no repayment.</p> <p>This language is necessary because a cash gift for down payment that requires you to pay it back isn't a gift at all - it's a loan that your lender must account for.</p> <p>Lastly, when you're getting a cash gift to buy a home, plan ahead. If you can receive the gift at least a month before your closing, it gives your lender extra time to do its due diligence.</p>]]></post_content>

HomeReady and HomePossible-eligible home buyers get access to discounts on mortgage rates up to zero-point-five-oh percentage points, which can reduce a monthly payment by a lot.</p> <p>Plus, if choose to make a small down payment with your HomeReady or HomePossible-branded mortgage, which you don’t have to, but if you do, you get a discount on your monthly mortgage insurance that other home buyers can’t get.</p> <p>Eligibility for HomeReady and HomePossible is location-based; it matters where you buy.</p> <p>So, reach out if you want to know more.

		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>Neighborhoods benefit when new home buyers move in.</p> <!--more--><p>New homeowners spend money in local stores, they make home improvements and beautify streets, and they pay taxes into the municipality.</p> <p>Homeownership is the centerpiece of local economies so local governments pay subsidies to make their areas more attractive to incoming buyers.</p> <p>The subsidies, known as Downpayment Assistance Programs, come in five forms:</p> <ul> <li>Cash grants for down payment</li> <li>Closing cost credits for your mortgage</li> <li>Interest rate reductions on your home loan</li> <li>Down payment loans for your home</li> <li>Tax bill credits to your municipality</li> </ul> <h2>Cash Grants For Your Down Payment</h2> <p>Cash grants account for the majority of down payment assistance programs. The average cash grant for a first-time home buyer is $10,000.</p> <p>When you receive a cash grant, it's a gift - there’s no requirement to repay it. However, many grant program stipulate that the money only becomes “free” after you've lived in your new house for a certain number of years — typically five.</p> <p>If you move out before the five years pass, the grant must be repaid.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Closing Costs Credits</h2> <p>Closing cost credits is another form of downpayment assistance.</p> <p>Closing cost credits is a one-time cash grant, paid at closing, to offset the costs with your purchase.</p> <p>Closing cost grants don’t have to be repaid, but generally require home buyers to purchase and live in their homes for a minimum of 3 years.</p> <p>Should you move out before the three years pass, the grant must be repaid.</p> <h2>Interest Rate Reductions</h2> <p>Some cities provide home buyers with cash to be used for buying discount points on their mortgage.</p> <p>Discount points are a one-time fee paid to your lender at closing in exchange for a lower interest rate.</p> <p>For example, if your quoted mortgage rate is 3.00 percent, after paying discount points with cash from your city, your rate might drop to 2.50 percent.</p> <h2>Down Payment Loans</h2> <p>Some local governments offer downpayment assistance programs that give interest-free loans to first-time buyers who want to make a downpayment.</p> <p>Loan terms are usually favorable – 0% interest - and the loan only comes due when the home gets sold in the future.</p> <p>Down payment loans are the least common of all five down payment assistance types.</p> <h2>Tax Bill Credits</h2> <p>Tax payment reductions are a variation on the down payment assistance theme.</p> <p>When you use a city's tax payment reduction stimulus, you get favorable, long-term tax treatment as the owner of a house, which lowers your tax bill and helps you save money.</p> <p>For help finding a down payment assistance program in your target city, ask us your question in the chat.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_title><![CDATA[How To Paper Trail Your Down Payment Gift For A Home]]></post_title>
		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/cash-gift-paper-trail]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[November 12, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<p>According to the National Association of REALTORS®, last year, more than 25 percent of home buyers under the age of 38 received at least <em>some&nbsp;</em>cash from family or friends that they used to make a down payment.</p> <!--more--><p>Receiving cash isn’t a problem; lenders don’t mind when buyers get gifts.</p> <p>Lenders have concern is that the “gift” you’re getting isn’t actually a gift; that everybody’s lying and the gift is actually a loan that you’ve agreed to pay back.</p> <p>Gifts that are really loans affect your ability to get mortgage-approved.</p> <p>Lenders are also concerned that the cash gift is coming from an illegal transaction of some sort. They worry that the real estate transaction is being used to launder the cash gift; to make the “dirty money” look clean.</p> <p>These are two specific concerns about cash gifts, and to squash them, lenders just ask for two specific things:</p> <ol> <li>A paper trail showing withdrawal and deposit slips from the giver and receiver of the gift</li> <li>A signed statement attesting that the gift is an actual gift</li> </ol> <p>The documentation is straight-forward, and simple to collect. Without it, though, your lender will declare your gift ineligible for use with your purchase.</p>]]></post_content>

		<post_title><![CDATA[What Is a USDA Loan and What Should You Know?]]></post_title>
		<post_slug><![CDATA[learn/what-is-a-usda-loan]]></post_slug>
		<post_date><![CDATA[November 9, 2020]]></post_date>
		<post_content><![CDATA[<h2>Brief History of USDA Loans</h2> <p>The USDA loan's story goes back to 1949 with the passing of the <a href="https://www.planning.org/awards/2014/1949housingact.htm"><span>American Housing Act</span></a>.</p> <!--more--><p>1949 was post-World War II when U.S. housing was in short supply and millions of families were sharing homes — sometimes willingly and sometimes not.</p> <p>Meanwhile, economic studies showed that homeownership could help build and strengthen weakened U.S. communities and create jobs that generate tax revenue.</p> <p>With that in mind, the American Housing Act was born.</p> <p>The law's passage cleared the way for millions of new homes to be built nationwide while making it easier for renters to become homeowners.</p> <p>New mortgage loans were made available by the government. Some loans had waived requirements for a down payment. The USDA mortgage, backed by the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/"><span>U.S Department of Agriculture</span></a>, was one such loan.</p> <p>The USDA program thrived and, today, the USDA supports hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. home loans; and communities all over the country.</p> <h2>How Do USDA Loans Work?</h2> <p>When you get a USDA loan, the U.S. Department of Agriculture guarantees your mortgage to your lender. By doing this, your lender knows that your payment will get made. This provides lower risk to the lender, allowing them to offer lower interest rates with no down payment.</p> <p>While USDA mortgages allow for 100% financing, you can make a down payment if you want. That down payment can come from you, or be a gift from a charitable organization, parent, grandparent, or another family member.</p> <h2>What Credit Score is Needed for a USDA Loan?</h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/RD-SFH-CreditRequirements.pdf"><span>USDA's official mortgage rulebook</span></a> says that home buyers must have a credit score of 640 to get approved, but it will approve home loans for buyers with credit scores below 640, and for buyers with no credit score at all, on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h2>Types of USDA Loans</h2> <p>There are only two types of USDA mortgages — 15-year fixed-rate loans and 30-year fixed-rate loans. No adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are available to home buyers through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's loan program.</p> <h2>How Do You Qualify for a USDA Loan?</h2> <p>To qualify for a USDA loan, you must follow the eligibility guidelines listed on the<a href="https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do"><span> USDA website</span></a>, which are:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Be a legal permanent U.S. resident</li> <li aria-level="1">Prove creditworthiness</li> <li aria-level="1">Maintain dependable income</li> <li aria-level="1">Have a household income matching 115 percent of the area's median income or lower</li> <li aria-level="1">Be the primary residence in a rural area</li> </ul> <h2>What's the Difference Between FHA and USDA Loans?</h2> <p>FHA loans and USDA loans differ in the requirements needed to qualify for the loan. Both are government-backed, but FHA requires a down payment of 3.5 percent, or $3,500 for every $100,000 in your home's sale price, whereas the USDA requires no down payment.</p> <p>FHA also has no specific location requirements, whereas the USDA loan requires that your residence is in a rural area.</p> <p>FHA also has more lenient credit score requirements. They don't enforce minimum credit score requirements at all, though lenders typically require a 580 minimum, and you can get an FHA approval without a credit score.</p> <p>Here’s a quick look at the difference in the requirements:</p> <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 312px; margin: 0px auto 20px;"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 62px;"> <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #5462d1; height: 62px;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">USDA Loans</span></td> <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #5462d1; height: 62px;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">FHA Loans</span></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 55px;"> <td style="text-align: center; height: 55px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">Residence must be in a rural area</span></td> <td style="text-align: center; height: 55px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">No location requirements</span></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 55px;"> <td style="text-align: center; height: 55px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">No down payment needed</span></td> <td style="text-align: center; height: 55px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">3.5 percent down payment needed</span></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 59px;"> <td style="text-align: center; height: 59px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">Low credit score required</span></td> <td style="text-align: center; height: 59px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">No credit score minimum required</span></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 66px;"> <td style="text-align: center; height: 66px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">Some income limitations</span></td> <td style="text-align: center; height: 66px; vertical-align: middle; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"><span style="color: #666666;">No income limitations</span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Do You Need to Pay Back a USDA Loan?</h2> <p>Yes, you need to pay back your USDA loan, even if you sell your house or move before your loan gets paid off.</p> <h2>What Are the Benefits of USDA Loans?</h2> <p>While USDA loans might not work for everyone, like those who want to buy a home in an urban area, these loans have many benefits. Here are some of the big ones:</p> <h3>No down payment needed</h3> <p>You don't need a twenty percent down payment to buy a house, and you haven't for over 70 years.</p> <p>If you prefer to buy a house with no money down, the 100 percent USDA home loan could be your best option.</p> <h3>Refinancing is easy</h3> <p>Should mortgage rates drop in the future, homeowners with USDA home loans can refinance quickly and easily through the USDA Streamline Refinance. To get approved, you only have to show that you've paid your mortgage on time for the last 12 months; and that the refinance will lower your payment by $50 per month.</p> <h3>Loans can also cover repair costs</h3> <p>USDA loans allow buyers to borrow 100% of a home's purchase price, plus another $27,500 on top of that for repairs and home improvement. Allowable repairs include replacing a roof, remodeling for accessibility of disabled persons, and for making energy-efficiency improvements to a house.</p> <h2>Are USDA Loans Assumable?</h2> <p>USDA mortgages are assumable, which means they can be transferred to future buyers of your house with the same interest rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Imagine selling your house with its current mortgage rate intact five years from now. Your home could be easier to see because of its already-low mortgage rate.</p> <h2>FAQ From Customers in Our Chat</h2> <h3>Why is the USDA loan also called a "rural loan"?</h3> <p>USDA loans are also known as "rural loans" because the U.S. Department of Agriculture backs the program, and the program intends to promote homeownership in areas that are lightly populated.</p> <p>"Lightly populated" includes rural neighborhoods, and in many regions, it describes the suburbs, too. 91% of United States land is within USDA eligible areas.</p> <h3>I have a working farm. Can I use the USDA loan?</h3> <p>No, USDA loans are not available to households with a working farm.</p> <h3>I am buying a new manufactured home. Can I use a USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use USDA loans to purchase new manufactured homes.</p> <h3>I am buying a modular home. Can I use a USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use USDA loans to purchase modular homes.</p> <h3>I am buying a condo. Can I use a USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use USDA loans to purchase condominiums.</p> <h3>What kind of credit rating do I need to use the USDA loan?</h3> <p>USDA mortgage guidelines state that borrowers should have a credit score of at least 640. However, the program allows exceptions for home buyers whose credit scores are below 640.</p> <h3>If I want to make a downpayment, can I still use the USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>Yes, you can make a downpayment using the USDA mortgage program. There is no requirement to finance 100% of your purchase.</p> <h3>What's the USDA maximum loan size?</h3> <p>Unlike FHA and other government-backed mortgages, there is no maximum loan size in the USDA mortgage program.</p> <h3>How do I know if the home I'm buying is eligible for a USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>Every home in the United States is either USDA loan-eligible or not. Use our USDA lookup map to search by area or address, or ask us to find your home's eligibility for you.</p> <h3>Can I rent my USDA-mortgaged home on Airbnb?</h3> <p>Yes, you can rent your USDA-mortgaged home on Airbnb. However, USDA loans are for primary residences only. You're allowed to rent a room(s) to travelers and can rent your home at times. However, the house's address has to be where you live for the majority of the year.</p> <h3>Do I have to be a first-time home buyer to use a USDA mortgage?</h3> <p>No, you don't have to be a first-time home buyer to use the USDA mortgage program.</p> <h3>What should I expect USDA mortgage closing costs to be?</h3> <p>USDA mortgage closing costs vary by the state in which you live and your lender. However, USDA loan costs are usually lower than other low and no down payment home loans.</p> <h3>What should I expect USDA mortgage rates to be?</h3> <p>USDA mortgage rates are lower than comparable conventional and FHA mortgages. It's typical for USDA mortgage rates to beat the interest rates of other loan types by as much as 0.50 percentage points.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>The government gave the USDA authority to create and fund a no-money-down home loan for buyers of homes in less-densely populated areas, including suburban neighborhoods outside of cities and large towns in rural zones. These areas make up more of the map than you may think.</p> <p>If you consider <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money"><span>buying a home with no money down</span></a>, check to see if the area you are interested in is rural. If it is, you may be eligible for a USDA loan. If not, there are many different home mortgages available with <a href="https://homebuyer.com/learn/low-down-payment-mortgage"><span>no or low down payments</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>We can help you find one that fits your needs.</p> <script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is the USDA loan also called a \"rural loan\""?""]]></post_content>
