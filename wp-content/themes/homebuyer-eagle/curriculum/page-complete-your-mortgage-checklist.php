        <p>When youâ€™re buying a home, there are a lot of moving parts. And it can be easy to forget about a document here or there. This is why most lenders provide you with a clear mortgage checklist that will serve as a simple roadmap guiding you through getting your mortgage loan.</p>
        <p>Go through the checklist carefully and get all documentation submitted to your lender as soon as possible. The more quickly you complete your checklist, the faster your application will move through processing, underwriting, and to final approval.</p>
