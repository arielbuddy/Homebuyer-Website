 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Last Updated November 3, 2023</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to your access and use of all products and services that are made available by Growella Inc or its affiliates through our websites or mobile applications, including but not limited to homebuyer.com (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information that we gather from you, how we use and disclose your information, and the steps we take to protect your information. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this policy.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not allow children under 13 years of age to use the Services, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Services are directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Services at any time or in any manner. If we learn that information has been collected through the Services from persons under 13 years of age, we will delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years of age has obtained a Growella account or provided us with information, please alert us at support@growella.com to request that we delete the information from our systems.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>
<p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to protect the integrity and security of your information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through the Services and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to your information, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users or other third parties with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post through the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services. Even after removal, copies of information that you have posted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other users have copied or stored such information.</p>

  
 <h2>The Information That We Collect</h2>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>When you use the Services to register for a HomeBuyer account, participate in online surveys or contact us with comments or questions or use other functions of the Services, you may provide us with information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, mobile phone number, age, gender, date of birth (“Personal Information”).</p>

<h3>Financial Information</h3>
<p>When you use the Services you may provide us with certain financial information including your Social Security Number, financial account information, investments, income, expenses, investible assets, investing risk tolerance, and other similar types of information (“Financial Information”).</p>

<h3>Cookies Information</h3>
<p>When you use the Services, we may send one or more Cookies (which are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer or mobile device. We may use both Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies. A Session Cookie disappears after you close your browser. A Persistent Cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. Persistent Cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your Cookie settings. If you delete, or choose not to accept, Cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.</p>

 <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
<p>When you use the Services or open an email from Homebuyer, we may automatically receive and record certain information from your computer, web browser and/or mobile device, including your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, hardware and software settings and configurations, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after visiting the Services, the pages you view on the Services, your actions on the Services, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Services. When you use the Services on a mobile device, we may also collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using GPS, cell phone tower or wifi network signals.</p>

<h2>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</h2>
<p>We may implement third party advertising or other content on the Services that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third party content provider to read and write Cookies to your web browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Services. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow a third party to collect information about you through their browser Cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by third parties, and Growella does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. A number of different targeting and advertising programs may be used on the Services.</p>

<h2>Information from Other Sources</h2>
<p>We may also obtain information about you from third party sources, such as our partners or advertisers. We may also, at your direction, receive information from consumer reporting agencies (such as credit scores) or third party services that provide a mechanism to share information you have provided to the third party through the use of an application program interface (API), such as the Twitter API. If we combine or associate information from other sources with your information that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms, and applicable law.</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Your information is an integral part of our operations, and we use it in a variety of ways in providing the Services and operating our business. For example:</p>
<p>We use the information that you provide to: (i) operate, maintain, enhance and provide all of the features of the Services and to enable third parties to provide additional services to you; (ii) understand and analyze the usages trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Services, to create new features and functionality, and to improve fraud detection and information security; (iii) contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service; (iv) address intellectual property, right of privacy or defamation issues related to content you have posted on the Services; (v) send you promotional materials, offers, and/or messages related to the Services and the activities of third parties we work with; (vi) personalize the Services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Services; (vii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (viii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Services and third-party marketing activities; (ix) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (x) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>
<p>Generally, you can opt-out of receiving promotional communications, through links provided in the messages, by updating your account preferences through the Services, or by contacting us directly at support@growella.com.</p>

<h2>When We Disclose Information</h2>
<h3>Financial Services</h3>
<p>If you use the Services to apply for a credit card or loan, request to match with a lender or credit card issuer for a prequalified loan offer, or submit another question or request you are expressly authorizing Growella to send your information, including your Financial Information to the third party that you specified in your request. Please be aware that any information you request Growella to send to third party providers will be subject to the privacy policies of that third party and Growella is not responsible for the third party provider’s use of your information. Please review the privacy policies of any third party provider before you use the Services to send a request or question.</p>
<h3>Public Posting</h3>
<p>You may choose to post a question or comment on publicly accessible portions of the Services. Please be aware that any information or images you post will be publicly available. Please do not post any information that could be used to identify you, your social security number, personal account information, or your location on the public portions of the Services.</p>
<h2>Other Disclosures</h2>
<p>We may disclose non-personally identifiable aggregated information about our users without restriction.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this policy, we disclose the potentially personally-identifying information you disclose to Growella only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide the Services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>

<p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, we disclose personally-identifying only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Growella, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via chat, a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>

<p>In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Growella or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Growella goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Growella may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, we will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your personally-identifying information if you expressly consent to the disclosure. By submitting a request through our Services, you consent to the disclosure of your information to third parties in order for us to carry out your request.</p>

<p>If you submit a request through our Services, a third party service provider may directly contact you with quotes or information via telephone, email, and/or fax even if you are on the National Do Not Call Registry or any other similar registry.</p>

<p>We make certain information available to third parties in a de-identified way, to: (i) comply with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Services.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Services.</p>

<p>Once you have registered for a Growella account, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page through the Services. Notwithstanding a request to delete information, we may maintain copies of your information if required by law and on archival copies of our information technology systems.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt-out of receiving email information from us (except for emails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password, and other similar communications essential to your transactions through the Services) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email. Although your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.</p>

<p>You have the option to refuse any free consultations or offers for services provided after you submit a request to a third party through the Services.</p>

<h2>International Visitors</h2>
<p>The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended solely for visitors located within the United States. <strong>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY UPLOADING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE SERVICES YOU WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SUCH INFORMATION OUTSIDE YOUR COUNTRY AND INTO THE UNITED STATES.</strong></p>

<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat your information, including by placing a prominent notice on the Services or by sending you an email so that you can choose whether to continue using the Services. Material modifications are effective 30 calendar days after our initial notification or upon your acceptance of the modified Terms. Immaterial modifications are effective upon posting of the updated Privacy Policy or Terms of Service on the Services. Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising hereunder will be resolved in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the dispute arose.</p>

<h2>Do Not Track Disclosures</h2>
<p>Third parties such as advertising networks, analytics providers, and widget providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you access or use our Services. Currently, various browsers offer a “Do Not Track” option, but there is no standard for how DNT should work on commercial websites. Due to lack of such standards, the Services do not respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The Services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.</p>

<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

<h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of the Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to support@growella.com or write us at:</p>
