  <h2>Homebuyer Announces Series Seed Funding</h2>
  <h3>Digital Mortgage Lender Focused On First-Time Home Buyers Raises $1.4 Million in Seed Round Investment</h3>
  <p>Cincinnati, OH &#8211; November 9, 2020 &#8212; Homebuyer, a software company offering digital mortgages to first-time home buyers, announced today that it has raised Series Seed funding totaling $1.4 million from private investors.</p>
  <p>Homebuyer was founded in 2019 by <a href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>/author/dan-green">Dan Green</a>, an ex-software engineer and former top-producing mortgage loan officer. Green built Homebuyer to make homeownership less expensive, less stressful, and more inclusive for aspiring U.S. homeowners.</p>
  <p>Homebuyer has created the industry’s first contextual mortgage experience for first-time home buyers. Homebuyer’s intelligent algorithms educate first-time home buyers using progressively personalized content, then funds those buyers’ mortgage loans as the originating mortgage lender.</p>
  <p>Homebuyer’s advancements in mortgage lending provide first-time home buyers with an end-to-end experience that’s faster, simpler, and less expensive as compared to traditional mortgage lending.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There are 2.5 million first-time home buyers every year in the United States,&#8221; said Green. “Homebuyer is the best way for each of them to learn about mortgages, get low direct-to-consumer mortgage rates, and affordably achieve their American Dream of homeownership.”</p>
  <p>Prior to founding Homebuyer, Dan Green founded The Mortgage Reports, a mortgage education website. The Mortgage Reports was acquired by Full Beaker.</p>
