Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>

<h3>11.1 The Services are Available “AS-IS”.</h3>
<p>Your access to and use of the Services are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, THE GROWELLA ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>The Growella Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services, or any content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Growella Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>

<p>The Growella Entities make no representations, warranties, or guarantees, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any third party service or advice provided by a third party, or any quotes or offers provided through the Services. Growella does not endorse any particular advisor or other third party. Growella acts solely as an intermediary between you and third party service providers and expressly disclaims any and all liability for any content, products, or services provided by such service providers.</p>

<h3>11.2 Links</h3>
<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Growella Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Growella Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

<h3>11.3 Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE GROWELLA ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.</p>

<p>In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Growella Entities exceed the greater of one hundred U.S. dollars (U.S. $100.00) or the amount you paid Growella, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise to the claim.</p>

<p>The limitations of this subsection shall apply to any theory of liability, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, and whether or not the Growella Entities have been informed of the possibility of any such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

<h3>11.4 Indemnity</h3>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Growella Entities from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services or (ii) your violation of these Terms.</p>

<h2>12. General Term</h2>

<h3>12.1 Waiver</h3>
<p>Any failure by Growella to exercise any of its respective rights, powers, or remedies under these Terms of Service, or any delay by Growella in doing so, does not constitute a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. The single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy by Growella does not prevent either from exercising any other rights, powers, or remedies.</p>

<h3>12.2 Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service, as amended from time to time, is determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability attaches only to such provision and everything else in these Terms of Service continues in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>12.3 Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>(a) Choice of Law: These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of Ohio, and shall be interpreted in all respects as a Ohio contract. Any dispute, controversy, claim or action arising from or related to your use of the Site or these Terms of Service likewise shall be governed by the laws of Ohio, exclusive of choice-of-law principles.</p>

The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Growella.</p>
<p>(ii) You agree that prior to filing for arbitration you shall send a written Notice of Dispute to Growella describing the nature and basis of the dispute and setting forth the relief sought.

The arbitrators shall be empowered to award money damages but may not award consequential, incidental, exemplary or punitive damages or order specific performance.</p>
<p>(iv) For claims under $10,000 Growella will reimburse you for the arbitration filing fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator determines your claim to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse Growella for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Growella on your behalf. For claims $10,000 and over, the payment of fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>(v) For claims under $10,000 you may elect for a document only arbitration through a telephonic hearing.</p>
<p>(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Growella agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in any competent court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<p>(vii) The Parties hereby consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of Hamilton County, Ohio, United States, for the enforcement of any arbitration award or for any other dispute related to the Services or the Agreement that is not properly submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p>(viii) If you are a new Growella user, you can choose to reject the arbitration agreement contained in this Section 12.3(a) (“opt-out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. The Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user name(s) and email address(es) associated with the Growella account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>(ix) If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, or if any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, the remainder of the Agreement, including any other provisions of Section 12, will continue to apply.</p>

<h3>12.4 Entire Agreement</h3>
